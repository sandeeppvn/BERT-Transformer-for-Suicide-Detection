2,"I apologize in advance for this being so long. I just couldn't stop typing.I want to die.I’ve done nothing, and I’m going nowhere. I know I’m going nowhere because the second I’m put under pressure, I crack and fall apart at the seams.Everyone thinks I’m this wonderful person and all I can do is hate myself. All I can feel is that they must be lying to me. I’m not smart, I’m not athletic, the only thing I would even consider myself remotely talented in is art, and we all know how far that shit takes you in life. I love science, but I’m probably just throwing myself into a field that I’m going to drown. The study I love, Virology, means likely trying to go for a PHD. I’m fooling myself if I think I can get that far. Just last year I nearly committed suicide from pushing myself to try to be in AP classes. I needed to keep improving myself, I needed to be smarter. Instead all I did was fall apart and had to be taken out of all of them half-way through the year and put into honors classes. My GPA was ruined, I failed one of my classes, and the thought of doing a problem on the board in front of everyone sends me into panic attacks. Instead I watched as my smart, well-adjusted friends were able to pull through and do well. Now it feels like I’m in a different world. All I can think is that they must see me pass in the hallway and think, “Remember her? She used to have such a promising future.”All I can think is that they must feel I didn’t try hard enough. After all, if they could do it, why shouldn’t I be able to? I have lost over the years my best friend. My first real friend. She lied to me twice- the first time it hurt, but I accepted it and tried to forgive. The second time was over the same issue, and felt like a knife in my stomach. And she knows I have trust issues ever since my parents divorced. She apologized for it once, and proceeded to try to act as though it never happened. If I even mentioned that I had been hurt by it, she would get sulky and say she *had* apologized, even if I barely remember it. So then I would feel guilty. When I tried to open up about how I felt when I was sad, it would immediately turn into essentially a dick-measuring contest of who’s sadder. But I still remember the nights we would spend watching LOST and stay up late talking about philosophy and books and, well, anything. I miss her so much, but I don’t even recognize her anymore. I feel I could never trust her again. We haven’t talked in months. And I know if I was to go to her and tell her all of this- she would immediately get defensive and deny everything. So I would shut up. Again.Like every fucking day.I hate my body. I hate it so much. The sponginess, the softness of it, the roundness- it’s absolutely sick and disgusting. My grandpa keeps acting as though calling me an attractive young woman is a compliment, despite knowing full well I’m attending therapy for transgender issues. When I point this out to him, he simply says, “Well, YOU ARE. It’s not like I’m going to LIE to you.” I suppose I’m lucky I’m afraid of pain, else I would have started self-harming years ago. The thought is tempting though. Sometimes I fantasize that my breasts are like large, disgusting zits and I can pop them like one. Or if I take a knife and make a slit from the underside, I’ll be able to just squeeze out pus and blood until it’s all out and I have a flat chest. When no one is around I try to move my chest in front of the microwave as much as possible in the hopes that it’s not an urban myth and that I can give myself breast cancer. Other times I’m convinced I can cut off my own skin. Just peel it off like a wetsuit. More than once I’ve considered actually trying it, peeling off this female skin and being able to see the real me underneath it. There’s nothing underneath though but blood, sinew and bone.Then there’s the fact that though I feel like a man, I am not very manly. At all. I am such a fucking girl it’s downright pathetic. How could anyone take me seriously when lately I cry at the drop of a hat? I’m weak, into arts and drama and know nothing about fishing, cars, sports, and my emotions swing back and forth like a pendulum. The moment I even start to feel confidant and as though that doesn’t really matter… well, let me just try to quote my grandfather on that. “Dramatic_pause, you don’t know *what* you want yet. Your grandfather has been around and gays and transgenders-“ disclaimer, he’s the type that predates a sexist remark with, ‘I have nothing against women!’ “- and worked with them before, and I’ve talked to doctors too. If you were really… *like that*, we would have seen signs earlier. I haven’t seen anything like that, and your grandfather is a smart whip.”Great.

I know a lot of you might scoff at this notion but it really is. _PERSON_ in post 9/11 Bible Belt is even harder. But really when I think about it it was always tough being me in this place and this time.     Born in the middle of nowhere hicksville USA, a brown baby that never quite fit in anywhere. My parents weren't abusive actively per se more unavailable, I learned at an early age that I was pretty much on my own. School was bad, if people weren't actively bullying me they were mostly pretending that I didn't exist. As a child I often hoped that this was the case, often wondered how nice it would have been not to been born. Odd, a child of kindergarten age regretting his own birth. The awkward middle school years weren't much better. More of the same, standing on the outside looking in. Seeing all the happy people, smiling faces, friends being friends, young love blooming in classrooms. I saw all this and wished it for myself and how I tried to get it. It never worked, I was met with near constant reminders that I don't belong, I don't fit in, no one wants me here. Stupid optimistic me thought it might change in the future. Fast forward to high school, still a loner, but not one of those creepy trench coated combat boot wearing ones. I try to be nice and friendly but it still is mostly thrown back into my face. This is about the time I started trying to find a girlfriend too. Foolish me didn't know down that road lay only more rejection and isolation and pain. After high school I did a 7 year stint in the Army, active duty infantry, saw a bit of action on deployments. What builds better bonds between people than shared danger and having to trust someone else to have your back and keep you alive? What builds better bonds? Well all of that with the exception that you can't be me. The only friend I did have in the Army I watched get blown apart by an IED. Came back from war to go to college, a late 20's freshman. Awkward, I felt like _PERSON_. A catholic private school was my choice due to the good science and pre-professional school program, but socially the place was...not inviting. I never could quite break down the barriers and get close to me. I stopped marking my birthdays long ago, facebook can be so cruel to remind you that it's your birthday when you have no one wishing you a happy one. Would have been a futile wish anyway. My best friend on birthdays came in bottles. I tried making friends or girlfriends at 21+ watering holes, events, school clubs. More and more this failed and the isolation really began to set in. They say no man is an island, this is true, unless he is forced to be.    As a side note, I have tried that whole online dating thing with more of the same result. That is to say nothing but rejection and being ignored.

Feel free to ask for more elaboration and I can copy over the wall-of-text that I wrote, or just explain more about what happened.My girlfriend just overdosed on one of my medications, propranolol/inderal. It had to've been over a hundred or two hundred 10mg/20mg tablets. She could have potentially been laying there for over an hour, as I was cooking and trying to give her some space. Thank god it wasn't my _PERSON_, as she **had** been taking it gradually from me over the past few weeks, mixing it with alcohol and forcing me to end up hiding it from her. I don't drink, I don't take any drugs outside my what's been prescribed to me. I've never been close to, or lived with an addict before. I don't know how to handle this.The paramedics came about 3 minutes after I called, and took her to a hospital nearby for what I'd assumed is for her stomach to be pumped and then for her to be put under a 72 hour psych evaluation. Right now, I have no idea how she is, if she's even alive. Is there anything I can do? Should I call up the hospital's patient inquiry line? Should I directly call the behavioral health ward and ask there? The police that accompanied the paramedics informed me that HIPAA guidelines restrict what can be told to me and that she's under their custody for 3 days. We're not married, she doesn't have any family here. I just want to know, right now, if she's alive.Also, she has no means of communication, and certainly doesn't/won't remember anyone's phone number nor address. Am I allowed to bring her cell phone to her? At least for her to call me when she's released/allowed calls out? I was asked if I wanted to come along in the ambulance, but I couldn't. I panic so easily. I should've gone so I'd at least know if she made it. Fuck.Right now, she doesn't have anyone really, outside of me. There is her mother, who allowed her to be raped multiple times while as a child and teenager, and then putting the blame on her for it happening. But she's in Iowa with me being in Texas, and I don't know how to contact her.I keep remembering her glazed over eyes as I found her lying on the floor, then them looking at me, grabbing my hand, before continuing to seize more. I keep thinking about how I might never get to talk to her again. I feel helpless and alone. Is there anything I can do? Please. I probably hadn't left my house outside of my psychiatrist's appointments for the past 4 years, before I met her. I'm painfully inexperienced in life, much more so in situations like these.

I hate myself so much. I wish I would just grow up but I find that hard to do. I'm improving but I've wasted so much of my life.I lost my job. I've been such a shit over the past several months that when I quit again my bosses just let me go.I'm  very self-involved. People tire of me quickly because I can never think of anything but me and my stupid problems, which wouldn't be problems if I would just grow up.I'm unhappy with myself because I'm not smart or motivated. I want to be really good at math. But a few days ago I sat down, to once again attempt to learn determinants, but something was gone. I've never had much mental energy but something was different those few days ago and now I truly feel I  have no hope to be good at math.I want to be smart, and if I can't be smart  I'd rather be dead. I'm interested in robots, engineering, philosophy, languages, all sorts of stuff. But I know none of it. I've failed college twice.

27,"Only this time it's goodbye. I tried to strangle myself again today and made it further than last time. I either put the laces too high or didn't go tight enough because I was still able to pump blood fine except for when I gulped. Then my adam's apple pulled the laces really tight and I could definitely feel like that was strangling me.Oh well, lesson for next time.I've decided to throw everything away and go be homeless for a time. I've got to try something new because I just can't keep going on like this.So I'm sorry SW, you guys were some of the best people I've met so far. I really regret that I cannot be here for you anymore.EDIT: Well I'm back. Or more precisely, I never left. I missed the bus I was going to take because it took longer to get to the depot than I thought. The next bus was at 10 pm. I waited, I got bored, I went walking. It was really beautiful out. The wind was warm and gentle, it was sunny and there were trees that were starting to bud. It felt like spring and it was really calm and soothing. The kind of moment you can live for.I decided that I can always be homeless later. It's probably going to happen anyway because I've not had much luck finding a job. Might as well take advantage of a good situation for as long as one can.Normally I would put something in here about seeking help but to be honest I'm not going to. I've always resisted going to the counsellors. Even if I do manage to get myself there I always stop going after awhile. There isn't really any reason for it, it's just an impulse that I've not managed to resist. I have little discipline or willpower.Though part of it is this idea that the healthcare system is overburdened and that my problems seem so little and stupid compared to those in the hospital it seems right to just manage as best as I can.I was thinking about it a lot last night and I think another reason is that maybe I like a little drama in my life. There is so much pludging through day after day that I feel a little crazy after awhile. I think I want to scream and storm, that I've been holding these things in for a whole lifetime and have never had an outlet and it always comes out eventually somehow doesn't it?So I'm still here. I will do my best to grow and to listen to others. I will study some philosophy in the hopes of distilling some wisdom useful to me. I will continue to program and study math because it makes my mind sharper.I think I grew a little a bit. I think I'm a little stronger. Somebody posted a quote from Micheal Jordan about how he succeeds because he repeatedly fails and I think I'm ready for that.“I have missed more than 9000 shots in my career.

33,"It can be really hard to think straight when I'm under but I always think back to my several attempts and realize that every time I was sincere up until the moment of actually doing it where I would then chicken out. I have been using this cowardiance to pull myself out of bad moods and since I've learned to make ""shifts"". I don't know how to describe them really except to say that what you're thinking has a big affect on what you're feeling.Like this morning. I woke up suicidal for the second day in a row and I decided that I would do it right that morning but I was slow to get out of bed and so my mind got to wandering. When it somehow ended up on the topic of language processing I spontaneously realized that I didn't want to go just yet, I wanted to study this subject a bit.But alas, not showing up for work two days in a row after only having the job for a month is bound to have serious consequences.What's worse is that instead of just calling in sick I phoned and told the boss who hired me that I had depression and that I took poor care of myself and that consequently I was an unreliable worker. I haven't heard back from him but I'm confident that I've lost the job.I've made my mother mad. I told her that I wanted to move out because she was always nagging me and that she didn't like it when I was angry and I just wanted to be left alone when I was like that. She had no idea what I was talking about and kept saying so and was really upset.I'm so pathetic. I'm 30 and ignorant as fuck. I'm only qualified to be a labourer. I can't concentrate and stay focused. I have no self-discipline and I've grown to hate the advice to just apply myself.But on a more positive note, I'm learning to just live my own life.I remember one time I was doing security work for construction crews working on a bridge, keeping people out from under the bridge and such, when this lady pulled up to ask some questions about what was going on. We ended up doing some small talk and she mentioned something about the number of suicides that had jumped from the bridge. Something must have happened in the expression on my face because she suddenly exclaimed ""Oh my god! You're thinking of suicide!"". Then she started laughing like crazy and took off. I guess she thought I was a loser and couldn't deal with someone so embarrassingly stupid.But the point is I've learned to just let stuff like that slide. So many people are jackasses, I can't let them get under my skin.I'm a little stronger now but I'm still out of control. I'm better at coping but I'm still deeply ashamed of how little progress I've made as a human being.I don't know what I'm going to do about my job. I think I will go in and talk to my boss in person and maybe that will make a better impression. I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't have the job. I will have one last paycheck and it's not unreasonable that I could have a new job in a couple weeks, though one never knows of course. But a big part of me just wants to kill myself and be done with it. I'm afraid of the future and what it will bring.So I'm on the fence here. I feel I could handle what's coming but I also feel that what's coming hurts too much and I must avoid it however possible.

It is a shit awful way to go, but what method isn't?I'm feeling sad right now. I decided to spend my last day on earth at one of my most  favorite places, the local university library. School was in and so there were a lot of people there. I was surprised at the number of good looking women there. Normally the populations I see are pretty homely.I discovered a bunch of cool books there. One's _PERSON_, which is a popular account of how information theory applies in describing people. I found Proofs and Types. I found a whole bunch of programming (as in math, optimization, not programming a computer). I read the introductory parts of a dynamic programming book and a geometric programming book. They were cool. I also read one on gravitational waves but it was kind of boring because it was one of those popular books that have too much history and not enough introducing me to the math.So now I'm feeling sad because even though I'm not bright I am tenacious. I could have spent my life working at the metfab shop and spending my free time at the library.But it is not to be. I can't cope anymore. I quit a job because they were going  to fire me for being late all the time. I can't get up in the mornings. I barely eat. Drugs and wanking  have lost their appeal. Life is just so tiresome.Even though I feel sad, I feel that I am making the right decision.

Even when I did my mandatory walk through the park it was not really outside because I was not disturbed and because I just walked the same path mechanically.I almost feel like I have a family now. Don't get me wrong, I'm not naive. Many of these homeless are criminals and eventually I will probably be mugged but I'm hanging out with a crazy bunch of people, some of whom are a lot of fun. I don't feel out of place or inadequate here. Same reason I like this reddit.My monkish nature is starting to express itself. I feel as if I'm living in a monastery. I'm practising acetism, giving up all my possessions and being dependent on others for food and shelter.I want to become a tutor and a counsellor to these people. I want to set up a farm where people who are down and out can go and raise veggies and herbs, learn cooking and crafts. There would be courses to teach people skills that will help them to get a job. So a lot like this shelter but with a garden and better food than donuts for breakfast and pancakes for dinner.I've had an insight into religion. I like the idea of the greek pantheon. But I don't literally claim that there are humanoid beings with great power walking around. Instead religion is just a very poetic way of expressing truth. That is what it should be. The ancients should be revered for their wisdom but they are not infallible. The poetry needs to update with the times.I've grown to like the idea of the Tao. Reality is the tao but what the fuck is it? We don't really know. We are settlers in a new land slowly figuring our way about. That is the truth of the tao.My sense of right and wrong has become a little weird. This was prompted by a book I was reading. Loosely based on history, there were a lot of executions, people being broken on wheels, or crushed between sandalwood longs, or suspended over a charcoal fire by chains, all for stupid reasons like failing to flatter a higher up or writing a poem that unintentionally insults the king.It made me face how brutal the world and humanity is. It made me realize that this is a part of life. In thinking about this I realized that even though it is natural that predators eat prey and calamities wipe out millions, the prey is optimized for defense and the humans are always seeking ways to forecast calamities.So I've made my peace with suffering. I don't seek and I probably won't handle it in a noble, stoic manner when it comes, but it is part of life. While I'm all for reducing the suffering in the world it will always be there and we have to make our peace with it and move on so we can live.I've been reading Krishnamurti again. What I like most about him is that he never just comes out says anything. He forces me to think. I tend to get too passive with the ordinary kind of book that just hands out knowledge. I think I'm almost getting what he's saying.So I guess what I'm trying to say here, to those of us that are troubled, is that while you are facing a terrible time and it seems like the end of the world, it is an opportunity for personal growth and at the end of your struggle you may find a prize.That's what I like most about this reddit.

42,"I'm in a really bad place right now.  I've been fighting an extremely powerful depression for about a year now.  My little foster brother died at age 11 in March 2014.  He was an innocent boy, played baseball for the local team, went to church, loved singing in the church musicals, and was super excited to be in band when he got old enough so he could be like me.  Then my stepfather died in September 2014 of lung cancer.  He was a very good man, took in my mom and us 3 boys after our father lost his mind to drugs and alcohol.  He wasn't very emotionally supportive but he helped us in ways I'm just now realizing.  He taught us how to fix basic issues with our car like oil/tire changes, fluid checks, etc.  He taught me how to set up a PC and how to make sure it's protected from viruses.  He taught us how to cook.  He was a great man that left behind two ex wives (one being my mom), two bio-daughters, and three stepsons.  I was doing okay after my foster brother died.  Then my stepdad died and I just fucking crashed.  I've been low since September and I can't get out of it.  I utterly failed a semester of college which put my graduation back a whole year, if it ever happens.  Nobody trusts me now, especially my professors.  I'm failing this semester too.  I'm just too fucking depressed to even get out of bed.  I don't even know why I would bother to go to college.  I'm a fucking bagboy at a grocery store at almost 23 years old, asking paper or plastic and pushing carts for minimum wage, and I can't even do that right.  There's no fucking way I can complete my major and be a teacher.  My mentor/good friend/ex-teacher wants me to graduate fast so I can work with her at my alma mater and take over for her when she leaves.  I don't know how to tell her she's placing her trust in a fucktard.  I'm dumb as a box of rocks.  I'm a drunk.  I'm an addict.  I'm unreliable.  I'm angry.  There's no way anybody will hire me with my college record.  I'm absolutely fucked on getting a real teaching job, if I ever graduate.  I'll probably just end up being a fucking bagboy for the rest of my life.  It doesn't help that all my friends are student teaching, getting ready to graduate, and auditioning for grad school.  And here I am, fucking five years into my degree already and a year behind.  Everybody I know will be graduating this semester and I'm stuck for another fucking year.  I quit my fraternity too, so I'll basically have no friends after May.  I'm gonna be stuck in a year of fucking loneliness.  I don't know why I should bother continuing school or why I should even bother living.  And my suicidal thoughts bring about a whole other level of guilt.  I can't fucking kill myself.  I have two brothers that I live with that depend on me emotionally, financially, and socially.  I have a fiancee that loves me and would be lost without me.  My mentor depends on me to take over her job when she moves on to bigger and better things.

47,but I'm not here to argue about what sounds harsh and what doesn't... I'm here because I need someone to talk to. As bad as I want to I can't kill myself. I have a .22 revolver on my nightstand behind me and idk if it's that I don't have the balls to put it to my head and pull the trigger or if I don't want to die I've been trying to figure that out for a while now. lately I can't help but think boy if only that truck coming towards me could just come into my lane head on or how I wish this gas pump would spontaneously blow up before I finish filling up my tank. Do you think I should be on suicide watch? Idk... I hate my life. I've been mad at the world lately for no reason. I hate my job. I hate myself. Tired of bottling shit in. I have trichotillomania (the irresistible urge to pluck out my own hair) disorder. No one knows until now because I've been able to hide it for 12 years but it's getting to where it's hard to conceal with what I have to work with. Tired of being stepped on talked down to judged and looked down upon. I don't want to be alive anymore. Well honestly I haven't wanted to be alive for about three years now. I've been taking anxiety medicine for about 5 months and when asked about what about depression I said none but after he asked me that I figured out I was born depressed. I was born weighing two pounds they had to attach me to machines and tubes and my mom said that I had took my pinky finger and yanked the tube out of my mouth. I was almost dead. I'm not supposed to be here. It's always been so severe and for so many years that I just been lying to myself that I was normal. I have tricked myself into believing that was happy because I simply cannot function when those feelings surface. My brain's ability to think straight shuts down. So I fool myself so I could carry on. I'd like to say I'm good at it.. Really good at it. Till now. My whole life is a lie. I know that now. My grandmother was a drug addict and crazy although she liked admitting to it my mom is crazy my uncle died from alcohol abuse my second cousin killed himself because he was tired of being pushed around because he was gay. I'm 24 and still living with my parents with no kids to be there for which gives me intensive but I think that's the only true reason I'm still here because my parents would be absolutely devastated.

48,"First here is some perspective- I am 51 years of age and my son (2nd of 3) is 17- He is a senior in high school set to graduate in 4 months- Our first indications of something wrong came from the school councilor who was acting on advice of my son's friends- Our second indication was a call from the police at the hospital where he was being cared for after a call for help. (I don't know if that call was real or a euphemism but there were no physical indications of trauma)- I've been letting the professionals handle it with 2 notable exceptions. After the first incident, I had a very rewarding talk with him where he appeared to open up to me. I had 1 piece of advice that he appeared to accept which was - *don't tell anyone what you think they want to hear. No one can help you unless you tell the truth and talk about what is truly bothering you*. The second exception was related to some poor (my assessment) decisions he was making with respect to dropping a class a school. He wouldn't explain his reasoning and his mind was made up. I had a discussion about making decisions and explained that it was my role to guide him and if he is refusing to be led then he is forcing me to make decisions based on lack of information and that is never a good thing.- They second incident resulted in a spat with my wife and I decided to pull back, reluctantly.- That brings us to a month agoSo last night he has made arrangements to be with some of his football buddies for a party of sorts. He has asked for and received permission to stay over if the situation is such that he wants to. He's also borrowed the family van so that he can assume his role of designated driver for anyone who wants to go home and has been drinking. Yes, he was always up front about being at parties where alcohol was available and we trust him, or at least there has been no reason not to trust him. (Read:Don't like it but I've gotta let go sometime)So, around 2-3am he comes home. So far so good, he had an opportunity to stay over but made a different decision. I go back to sleep. 6 am I notice my wife is not in bed. I'll give you more point form as I don't think you want to read what's in my head- He's upset coming home- He reveals he didn't go to a party- Instead he met a girl that he met online in a town 1 hour away- He got a speeding ticket coming back- He knew he was busted but was hoping that I wouldn't find out- My wife is beside herself with worryA little more about me. When I was 18 and hosting a party at my house, I had an incident. It involved a loaded shotgun and were it not for the safety, I would not be writing this to you. As Forest Gump would say: That's all I'm gonna say about that. Further, my eldest brother is a diagnosed schizophrenic with manic depressive tendencies (Bipolar) and my elder brother has a non-diagnosed inferiority complex that severely interferes with his social skills. We are all above average in intelligence but feel undeserving of such. It is more of a curse than you know to be able to analyse things so well and self analyse so poorly. For the record no one can self analyse well, that's a trap.I know how I want to proceed but I don't want to bias the responses.

53,"Lets start nicely, shall we? I'm not going to kill myself. Four weeks ago, I finished my freshman year of college. I made friends, got great grades, and even got asked out. It wasn't a bad year. However, a *few* things were wrong... My parents, especially my dad, have been putting on the pressure to constantly be better at everything. They keep reminding me that I don't go to school to make friends... ""in a couple of years, you won't remember anyone you met at college"" ect. This is disheartening because I've never really had close friends before. Suddenly, I have people I care about, and I'm being told to not care. Also, I know I have detachment issues. I push people away, simply because I'm pretty private. I keep my emotions in check, and some people don't like that. This semester, I had a guy express interest in having a relationship with me, but he was put off by the fact that I didn't really *give* him the emotional response he was looking for. To add to the ""guy problems"", I don't know if I'm even interested in guys at all. I've always found girls more attractive, but I've never had any sexual experiences to sway me one way or the other. I'm 19, and I've never even kissed anyone else. Maybe asexual? My lack of experience isn't really bothersome, but rather the confusion associated with it. Anyway, I had minor problems while in school, but now that I'm home, things have gotten infinitely worse.  My parents just want me to get a job, and at this stage in my life, that's all I want too. I've applied so many different places, but I can't seem to even get a return call back from them. My resume is stacked, and I'm a very personable person. I've handed most of my apps in in-person, and I've followed up. After 4 weeks of looking for a stupid, min-wage summer job and having no result, I'm beginning to feel terrible about myself. Having a job was the only thing I had planned this summer, and so no I have no purpose. Also, I'm totally alone. I live in a really rural area where most of my friends live no closer than 15 minutes away by car. My best friend is currently 3 hours away, and will be the entire summer. Because I'm a detached person, I've dug myself into a hole, and have very few close friends at the moment. I'm alone 80% of the day, and when I'm around people, I tend to be irritable and angry, which is not normal for me. I don't know if there's anything to be done here. I just needed to tell somebody stuff. I write a lot of this stuff down, but I never tell anyone because that's just not who I am. Lastly, not to drop the bombshell, but I used to self harm. I thought I had stopped, but over the past semester, I cut 4 times. I'm ashamed about it, which is the main thing that keeps me from doing it now that I'm home, but it really helps me relieve emotional pressure. Emotional pressure is building, and I don't know how long I can sit in my house all day feeling hopeless and helpless without something snapping. sorry for rambling. Have a lovely day.

I got a bunch of money from a lawsuit from breaking my back in a car accident and basically blew almost half of it. My dad left our family about the time I broke my back and ever since this year we dont really have a relationship and he always talks shit about me and my family. Since he left we cant afford our house and we had to sell it and now we were staying at my aunts this month and tomorrow my mom gets to move into her new apartment with my brother and sister. There arent enough rooms so I have to sleep on the couch. We would probably have a much nicer place if my mom wasnt an alcoholic. She is extremely irresponsible and I did this whole moving thing extremely wrong.I actually wasnt even supposed to move in with her, I was supposed to move to Illinois (I live in NJ) with my fiance to get our own place and hopefully start my new life but we got into a huge fight today. I was actually supposed to pick up the moving truck tomorrow but im gonna have to cancel it. Not to mention on top of that I have to give away my dog because the place isnt pet friendly. My mom is supposed to move in 2 days and I still have no idea where the dog is going because I kinda almost made myself not believe it and kept putting it to the side.My fiance just found out today that her sister who she hates to the point where she wants her dead has uterine cancer. Shes been treating me like shit this entire day, and when shes mad I kinda feel like her punching bag so if shes upset about her sister shes definitely taking it out on me. The last thing shes basically said was calling me a loser and to enjoy sleeping on my mothers couch because I blew up her phone for like an hour and kept asking her what I did to deserve the treatment she was giving me. So I guess you can say shes playing a decent role to why im so fucked up right now.On top of all this I think I can say I have an addiction to pain pills and benzos. _PERSON_ been on and off them for like 2 years but the past few months its gotten worse. I had to of spent at least a grand in the past couple months. I don think I can live without benzos because its the only thing that helps me be more social. I dont have a job, I didnt go to college.

I actually dreamed about myself, having a conversation with myself, about my life and the situations that seem to manifest and cause me to be negative about everything. Here is a basic run-down of what advice I got from myself:""Dude, listen, from what you're saying, life is full of guessing games and 'what-ifs' about the future. When your life is full of shit, at a moment or a period of moments, you start to think negatively and 'what if it all stays like this forever? It's never going to get better'. I'm here to tell you that, just as you don't know it won't get better, you sure as fuck don't know if it will. You think negatively and say 'All of this won't get better, ever. I'm not going anywhere, my life is shit and there's no other way out. I will never succeed, be successful, happy or feel needed, ever.' Take that into consideration, man, and now think about this for a second: You don't know for a fact things will stay this way, so what about thinking about the opposite for a change? What if everything, all of your dreams and hopes, came true? What if the love of your life comes through for you and treats you like it's heaven on earth? What if you become massively happy and successful to no ends and live a life that's just so vast, pure and beautiful that when you look back on this horrible moment, you can finally think to yourself 'I cannot believe I almost gave up on such a wonderful odyssey.' What if your life becomes absolutely brilliant and full of wonder? What if? Life is a gamble, man, and you know what, think of it as nothing but a giant casino, full of prizes and rigged with crap, because, it is. Life is a gamble in the casino, and I'll be DAMNED if I'm going to let you allow the house to win this bet!""Case in point: I've never been happier to wake up than I am. I've always woken up either numb or depressed, but I've finally woken up, I mean REALLY woken up. Advice from myself to myself, wow. Powerful stuff, and inside, I think we all know there is that 'us' that should be smacking the hell out of ourselves and just making us realize that life is random and whatever you put into it.

Seeing as I cannot for the life of me find any advice from friends, parents or close acquaintances (trust me, I've tried.) So here goes:My closest friend is currently suffering from depression and severe anxiety, it's got to the stage now where I feel for his safety because he is regularly self-harming. Just this week he lost his temper in front of his girlfriend and proceeded to hit his head on the steering wheel of his car until he drew blood. He says that he's trying to get help but I have no idea whether this is actually true. Allegedly, he is currently on antidepressants and is seeing a counsellor.He acts completely normally around our mutual friends, he goes out drinking, he smokes weed and generally does everything that he used to do before he started becoming ill. He's essentially leading a double life, because on one hand he's severely depressed, and on the other he acts as if nothing is wrong.On several occasions I've had conversations with him about his depression but it always seems as if he's just saying what he thinks I want to hear. He regularly lies about his situation, acts like nothing is wrong and says he's trying his hardest to get on the right track.I'm at the point now where I cannot keep waiting for something to bad to happen (i.e. him accidentally killing himself) and I feel that I need to act. On another note, he's parents aren't aware of the severity of his situation and don't seem to be able to help in any way at all.Also, I reside in the UK and the NHS doesn't seem to have any advice for me, NHS direct just tell me that he needs to help himself and go to counsellors/his general practitioner but I can't trust him to do that.Does anyone know what I can do to help him? Does anyone have any experience in a situation like this?I feel out of my depth and I just want some guidance so I can move forward and help out my friend in the long term.TL;DR: A friend of mine is severely depressed and a danger to himself, how can I get him on the right track?",0,5,404,reddit moment bit tight spot decided write text post site advice life find advice friends parents close acquaintances trust closest friend suffering depression severe anxiety stage feel safety regularly harming week lost temper front girlfriend proceeded hit head steering wheel car drew blood idea true allegedly antidepressants counsellor acts completely mutual friends drinking smokes weed generally started ill essentially leading double life hand severely depressed acts wrong occasions conversations depression thinks hear regularly lies situation acts wrong hardest track point waiting bad happen accidentally killing feel act note parents aware severity situation reside uk nhs advice nhs direct counsellors general practitioner trust experience situation feel depth guidance move forward friend long term tl dr friend mine severely depressed danger track,9.0,16.0,8,5,3,9,3,11,1,13

The only person who knows about the problems I'm having at school is my boyfriend. We've been dating for a year. Well last night we kind of had a bit of an argument. I say kind of because it was more him getting annoyed and telling me I'm not trying enough and me just agreeing with him to make it go away. I'm probably not trying enough and I could probably do better. I should have my high school it's not that hard of a goal. I mean, I should be in some form of post secondary school by now (even though I have no way in hell to afford it).Last night it got to the point where I was counting out how many pills I have and whether or not it would likely kill me to take all of them. It likely wouldn't but considering my grandfather doesn't notice if I leave the house or not, I wouldn't get medical help until thursday because that's when my mom visits.I think the main reasons I haven't done anything is because of my mom, my boyfriend, and my oldest niece who considers me her best friend. I think she could have it explained to her if I did go through with suicide (she's gifted) but I don't want her to have to understand this concept...I don't want to leave her.But I'm screwing up my life. I don't want to keep going this way. I've tried going to a hospital before for suicidal thoughts but I was told that ""I'm not the type"" and I should sleep off the feelings. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to give up so badly but I don't how to make it any easier for them. I mean, mom's busy worrying abiut grandpa's health and I don't want to burden her. I could get into a fight with my boyfriend and breakup with him...That could make it easier on him but that still leaves two people...I don't know how to get help or what to do anymore...I'm still thinking about it but I still have a few things left to do. I'm buying my boyfriend's birthday present next weekend and the weekend after I'm babysitting that niece I mentioned earlier. After that...I don't know what there is to cling onto.

87,"Sorry I just need to get this off my chest. Sorry for posting. Just need to unload on a place where nobody knows me.I know I sound crazy but hear me out. I'm a trans guy who will be 22 this may. I'm depressed, have a shit ton of anxiety and just recently got diagnosed with body dysphoria. I was born as a baby girl and yet I can't identify with it. I recently got put on testosterone and hormone blockers to stop my body from producing estrogen.However it hasn't made any big changes which I understand. That stuff takes time. But until then I'm stuck looking like this lie that I tell everyone around me. To random people who pass me by, they see a girl. To my gay best friend, I'm a girl (I'm not mad that he doesn't like me...just wish my biology didn't work against me). To my grandfather who I live with (thanks to everyone in my family urging me not to tell him) I'm a girl. To my mother who still doesn't want to see her beautiful, thin, blond daughter who was everything she never was (her words, not mine) I'm still a girl. And I hate it. Typing this makes me feel sick to my stomach and angry.I...can't do this anymore. I look at myself and see a person who I can't continue to care about or identify with. I hate it more than I've hated anything else. I was always told that the worst thing I could do is lie. But living like this is just another lie that I can't wait to unbubble. I can't keep dealing with people seeing this false image of myself. Can't stand to see this image of myself. Can't stand to look myself in the eyes. I'm writing my goodbyes tonight. I just...I can't say goodbye in person.I've had a lot of time to think about this. I got sick with the flu this week and was bedridden and by myself a lot. I used to date someone who feels like my opposite. Back then, she was just coming to terms with being trans and I supported her. I'll admit it, I was jealous. I was jealous when I saw her smile when I did her makeup and hair. When she looked better in my clothes than I did I felt envy. That comfort she was able to see. She was able to see herself as a woman.I want that. Hard as I try to find anything that makes me look boyish, feminine attributes keep showing up. I can't hide my chest (even with binding) and my mother is utterly against me getting a haircut that is ""too short"". Why the hell can't I just do it regardless? I don't know why it's easier for me to come to terms with dying than getting her disapproval.Not to mention that in a couple of months I lose my medical plan so all of my meds are no longer going to be covered. There's no way I'll be able to afford everything. The antidepressants,  the anti anxiety meds, the asthma meds, and then the hormone stuff...especially with no job, I won't be able to afford it. And if I went on disability, I'd just disappoint my mother again. She's very vocal about how she wants me to get a steady job and go to post secondary. She's terrified I'll get disability. According to her, I'm not that bad off. The depression and anxiety isn't that bad. I should be able to keep a job...it shouldn't be an issue...Well at least this way, she can still have me buried with my legal female name. Might even be buried in a dress since I don't have a suit. Guess she'll still have that girl image she clings to. At least she'll be happy with the way she remembers me._PERSON_: trans guy who can't be patient with the time it takes to transition.

88,"Dear reddit, four years ago my boyfriend committed suicide, and I hated him for it. At first I was so angry with him that I didn't realise how depressed I really was, and eventually how suicidal I had also become. I luckily had a very close friend who pulled me through this, and eventually we became a couple. This weekend I found out that he has been cheating on me for almost a year and a half. Depression is something that I have been struggling with for so long, that it's hard to see the point any more. Even when things have been good, it's only ever been temporary. I feel like I've lost my lifeline, as well as feeling so incredibly betrayed by the only person I've ever really trusted.

I also had to talk to my mom about it. now I'm afraid my mom may use it to attempt to take us away from our dad.

Despite having had a lot of support, both professionally and from friends, I don't seem to have ever made progress and I'm inclined to believe that life just isn't worth it.When I tell people that I want to die, they say I shouldn't do it because it will get better eventually... but will it?

I have made plans that I could use to kill myself in a foolproof and painless way, but they require things that take forethought to acquire, and I'm yet to have mustered sufficient resolve to actually started actioning an attempt on my life.I'm just really in two minds about the whole thing.

111,"A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, after having symptoms since the end of last year. I don't know what to believe anymore. Some days it's easier to believe that I'm just sick and all the beliefs I get about the world and other people, and the voices I hear, are just part of it. But most days I get sucked in, I can't stop thinking about these other worlds(dimensions) and people watching me, judging me, that people in another dimension need my help and I have to kill myself to get to them because that's what they keep telling me to do. I had to stop working, because I was hospitalized for getting really suicidal and psychotic. The hospital is where I got diagnosed. I'm off meds currently because I couldn't stand the side effects of them so i just stopped, about two and a half weeks ago or so. I just started working again, only 3 days a week at a web design company. I don't know what I want to do with the rest of my life. I feel broken. I was so sure I was going to get into making websites and stuff, and I feel like I want to know more, I know html and just looking at code makes me feel good because I love that I can understand it when I remember so clearly a time when I thought it was the most difficult thing ever and it all looked like an alien language. So I guess I'm proud of myself for learning it, even though it wasn't that hard and it's not a big thing. I just like that I can make sense of something that I couldn't before. So that's one good thing. I used to draw a lot. Now I don't. I just kinda fell out of it, from being sick. I feel stuck. I was sexually abused as a kid. And that factors into some of my ""delusions"", well, it's one of my beliefs that I don't really talk about because the one person I told assured me it wasn't real. But it haunts me. It hurts so much. I'm alone and I'm worthless and I feel like I'm never going to be as special as I felt when I was a kid getting a bunch of attention from this pedophile I though was my friend. I feel like I've lost myself this year. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what kind of future I see when sometimes it's so hard to focus and think and I feel so stupid. The best thing in my life is my nephew. He's the #1 reason I don't kill myself. Because if I can't be sure of anything, and I don't know if this is reality anymore, and everything is fucked. I know he's real, because I've watched him grow up, and he's almost a kid, and it's amazing seeing him learn and change and I'm scared to go and lose seeing more of that. But at the same time I'm through with being hurt and sad and my brain not working, I'm through with questioning every gorram thing and every person that looks at me. it's exhausting. It's so lonely to hear voices telling me that they need my help and I have to kill myself and nobody seems to care or understand it. Anyone have any idea what I'm supposed to do next? It's either kill myself or find something meaningful to do for myself and I'm lost about it. It doesn't seem like there's anything I can do to escape this. Schizophrenia is sort of a lifelong thing.

I've thought about it enough.He won't remember me. He's only 3. He won't remember. I won't be too important in his life if I go now. I don't want to leave him. I want to watch him grow up into a successful little human and earn all his happiness. I want to watch him be the good person I know he will be because his heart is so sweet. But I don't get that.

Ive had depression and anxiety issues since I was young. My first attempted suicide I was only seven years old. I watched my dad abuse our dogs, abuse me, and abuse alcohol on a regular basis. My mom kept herself locked in her room, leaving me and my sisters alone every day. Ever since ive been at war with my own mind. As I grew older everything got worse and worse. I started using drugs, became a sex addict, and pushed away everyone who tried helping. The only person I trusted was Christina. This girl was my world. We dated all throughout highschool and a while after. When she got pregnant I joined the army as a way to support them. Even though I had what seemed to be a great life, I couldnt shake the suicidal thoughts. Things went south. One night she had to talk me off a roof, and it was more than she could handle. She left me and took my son. I was devastated. For months I wouldnt talk to anybody or leave the house. Eventually I went broke and became homeless. Jumping around from place to place, the drug use got worse. After a few years, I fell back in love. I was depressed, but so was she. We would lock ourselves in a basement smoking pot and sniffing dope. Over time we both cleaned up. Ive been working part time and trying to keep myself clean. Recently, she left me as well, letting me know explicitly that she only wants drugs and sex from random guys. I was crushed. Now im at an old friends, wasting away day after day. I battle suicidal thoughts constantly, never trusting myself around ropes or sharp objects. Ive tried to control myself, but I find myself lashing out, slicing my chest and scalp, stabbing my legs and forearms. I do not wish to do this, something simply takes hold of me and forces my hand. At those moments, I dont care if I live or die, and that scares me. The amount of blood ive seen pour out of me before passing out has made me certain would never wake, yet here we are today. Im not a violent person towards anyone but myself, even blaming myself for other people wronging me. I can never trust myself, as im constantly plagued by these dark thoughts. I know one day my life will end by way of my own hand, and ive accepted that. Now I just battle myself every day, seeing how long I can last.

129,"This life has many ideas that can help the world.But what's the point of life if the world, including me, can't help myself?All I want is love, but after a time I realized my family isn't a lovely one, it was just a family with all members loving each other, but our mean was hatred to non-christian society. A desire to get away from humans that dare act natural in specific ways.I know how to be alone quite well. I'm quite good at it. Of course, there is my brother, who provides much comfort and plenty of lighthearted jokes that are fun to be a part of. But everyone in my family, I can feel them all expecting me to change back to who I was when I was younger.I smoke pot and dropped out because I felt like school was a waste of time. To you, I'm your typical drop out nut job. I am a nut job, because I know what people mean when they say that. They mean I do the things that they would be uncomfortable doing themself, I say GReAT good for you want a fucking trophy! I love this planet so much and life an biology all can get me so excited. Not to mention the other sciences, which are so captivating to the brain I was born with. I am so passionate about our Universe, I am even quite grippy on my own life. But the thing is, I just don't see the horizon anymore. I think becoming someone acceptable to society is an extremely stupid cause, one of ignorance and desire. Something that bothers me is that people do not see that as a sensible perspective of our society. I don't blame people for ignoring great facts and conforming to whatever gets them at least the minimal amount of dopamine their brain wants. To blame people is pointless, I hate blaming, my father always loved to analyze who is to blame for every fault, Eventually I saw it differently that the mistakes are what makes us, literally. I look around and I don't see a perfect society, and that's fine everyone does that and they think about it every long afternoon and get on with their busy lives. Me? I had a lot more time to think. The truth is, if society was set up differently, we would each and all have found our best friends. How? Well, first it would require a society that cares about the human biology and the first inventions: Nature. Our society, here in America at least, is concerned with profits. The feeling I get about America's history is that the intention of this design was so that people can have a life to their own, versus how it was in England where everything for a single person was not immune from the monarchy's every desire.My life is sad, because I am sad. I am less sad when I remember suicide. I have no close friend for many miles. But I have no one that is like me, no one that got as excited as purely for simply being alive. Besides, if I go to pass, it will be a small loss for you all, I promise. If you don't believe me, [well](_URL_ yeah. I know that value is an imagined thing and I can assign value to my life, and I in fact value my life extremely. This is not a matter of logic, it is a matter of feeling. You know how you felt like marrying that one person? And so you did? That's the same with people who commit suicide. They feel like dying over and over again and every time it interacts with their logic thus compounds more and more as a real possibility. I have reached a point I've reached many times where it seems like a good idea to commit suicide. The reason I may want to really do it is because I always reach a state where I feel alienated from the people I hold tender. One thing I noticed is I have become narcissistic, and by a very traditional sense; I barely post on social media websites. I actually just enjoy my own company, and I used to think when I was young and children would call me weird, and now today my brother who visits from out of state he calls me weird. I don't mind being called weird, except for when it is said in these instances. The weird that people say just so they can get away from absorbing you. Their mind says ""delete that act because it's useless"". To me, being weird is life. Doing things for the sake of doing them instead of for a purpose is what I want to do with my life. Truly, it's what everyone wants to do! I know I can escape my suicidal thoughts, but, is it worth it?Let me add, I know how getting into a routine of any sort will help me to distract myself from suicide. I do not want a distraction, I want to fix my problems at the root and to me what fixing my problems at the root means learning how to survive in nature and leaving for any edge into a forest for good. I would actually love to do that, but I would far much prefer to live anywhere where there are people willing to meet disagreement with acceptance. I want to meet inquisitive people, they are quite rare aren't they? Many people think they are great thinkers but really they are just good at talking.If you want to send me videos, articles, book titles whatever, that would be fine. Thank you for reading this internet buddy.Just read my post before posting, and here's a the main reason: Humans crave ludicrously to be part of a community. Thankfully, we are all born into a community. However, at some point in our life we realize we have different core beliefs than the community does, so we feel so alienated that we would hope for a while, and eventually, like a sun setting, we lose hope, we didn't run fast enough, whatever the cause, and we just realize that when we are so alone in our core beliefs that the only one that will truly feel the pain of your loss is no one. The feeling of alienation is only bad when people do it with a heart of hatred, to alienate someone with love is to naturally alienate them and then fight the alienating response your having and to be kind to them. I haven't felt love in a long time, just dopamine from people telling me that they do.",0,9,1119,life ideas world point life world including love time realized family lovely family members loving hatred christian society desire humans dare act natural specific ways good brother comfort plenty lighthearted jokes fun part family feel expecting change back younger smoke pot dropped felt school waste time typical drop nut job nut job people things uncomfortable themself great good fucking trophy love planet life biology excited mention sciences captivating brain born passionate universe grippy life thing horizon anymore acceptable society extremely stupid ignorance desire bothers people perspective society blame people ignoring great facts conforming minimal amount dopamine brain blame people pointless hate blaming father loved analyze blame fault eventually differently mistakes makes literally perfect society fine long afternoon busy lives lot time truth society set differently found friends require society cares human biology inventions nature society america concerned profits feeling america history intention design people life versus england single person immune monarchy desire life sad sad sad remember suicide close friend miles excited purely simply alive pass small loss promise url yeah imagined thing assign life fact life extremely matter logic matter feeling felt marrying person people commit suicide feel dying time interacts logic compounds real possibility reached point reached times good idea commit suicide reason reach state feel alienated people hold tender thing noticed narcissistic traditional sense barely post social media websites enjoy company young children call weird today brother visits state calls weird mind called weird instances weird people absorbing mind delete act useless weird life things sake purpose life escape suicidal thoughts worth add routine sort distract suicide distraction fix problems root fixing problems root means learning survive nature leaving edge forest good love prefer live people meet disagreement acceptance meet inquisitive people rare people great thinkers good talking send videos articles book titles fine reading internet buddy read post posting main reason humans crave ludicrously part community thankfully born community point life realize core beliefs community feel alienated hope eventually sun setting lose hope run fast realize core beliefs feel pain loss feeling alienation bad people heart hatred alienate love naturally alienate fight alienating response kind felt love long time dopamine people telling,66.0,45.0,25,37,22,22,34,25,19,40

144,"Four years ago I was 19 and I was living 10 hours away from all of my family and friend. I wish in my freshman year of college and was stretching myself thin. At the time this took place I was taking 6 classes and was involved in the theatre so my time was limited. I had been battling with depression for years but never told anyone about it. I felt that I had nothing to be depressed about. I had a good family, a nice place to live, my intelligence and a small group of good friends but I never felt like I really connected to people. I went so far away to school to remake myself in hopes that it would help.It didn't.One night in October, I had enough. I was done. Nothing really set this off. I had one friend and I was dating someone at the time but I didn't see the point in going on. My roommate was gone (I lived in a dorm and we shared a room) so I proceeded to down a bottle of pills. I laid down thinking ""Well, this is it"" and went to sleep.4 hours later I woke up and ran to the bathroom. I spent the next 6 hours with my head in a toilet. Once morning hit (about 8am) I texted my boyfriend and told him I was sick and he called campus police who drove me to the hospital. I was checked in and when they asked what happened I told them I blacked out. I must have lied well enough in that they didn't think it was a suicide attempt. They made me drink this foul tasting stuff to help my liver filter out the pills and the next day I was back at my dorm. About 5 hours later they called and said poison control said I needed to come back in for more medication. I was in for another night receiving medication and getting my blood drawn to test my liver. Once I was cleared, I was out of the hospital and back to my dorm. A few weeks later, I told my friend and boyfriend what really happened and they urged me to get help.I went to the college's counseling center after a few other people had told me they wouldn't push drugs (I was very against them). I went and filled out a ton of forms that I thought were completely idiotic.After she read the forms she said that she wasn't trained to handle cases like mine and referred me to a psychiatrist. I went to meet with him 3 days later and he diagnosed me with Major Depression. He said that while talking would help, my problems were chemical and that I needed medication. After a couple weeks of resisting the meds, I relented and got the prescription filled. My initial dose screwed me up. I was irritable, anxious and it made my depression much worse. He said that if I was having any running thoughts (I was) or suicidal ideas (I was) to call him ASAP so I did. He said to go the hospital and let them know who he was and who I was. They immediately put me on suicide watch but because I wasn't manic or out-of-control, they didn't lock me in the room. They let me sleep there and the next morning they put me on a gurney and strapped me down.The next thing I know I'm being transported to a mental health facility about an hour an a half away. I was there for 3 days. Because I was 19 I was legally an adult and they put me with all of the adults in the center. Emotionally, I was not an adult at all. I was mostly with drug addicts but we did see a few clinically insane people. My first day I cried. I was considered a risk to myself so I couldn't check myself out and I had a major panic attack when they told me I couldn't leave.The second day, I played the game. I did what they wanted me to do-I went to group meetings, I listened to what the doctors and nurses said. But something odd happened.  As I was playing along, I realized things were actually helping. The ""stupid"" activities were actually making me feel better. I'm smart enough to know what they were doing so I thought I was above it but it worked.Two days later I was released and sent back to school. I went back to the psychiatrist and yelled at him a bit for telling me to go to the hospital and at the end of my rant, I cried and thanked him. He lowered the dose on my meds and that stopped the problems I was having.Flash forward 4 years later. I'm still on my meds-I've attempted to go off them or change them but nothing works as well as they do and without them, I go back to being the depressed teenager I was.I'm now married and have 1 year old twin girls. I do worry about what my girls are going to think about me needing medication to be a normal human being but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.I don't believe meds are always the answer and I don't believe that everyone should go spend a few days in a psych ward, but it worked for me. Hopefully every one of you will realize that there is something out there for you. Please don't do what I did. It's the only thing in my life I'm happy I failed at.

I think i have friends but i'm not sure they really are there for me. And recently a very complicated friendship of mine ended and this other person just ignored me completly out of no where and i tried and tried to atleast get some sort of ""i dont want to speak to you anymore"" or some final good bye because since then it just feels like it opened up every history of being rejected and feeling less than. I just wanted to be okay. I know there is no ""normal"" but i know the way i am and how i react to issues and people isnt how other people are.

148,"Okay so recently my ex(m 17) and I broke up with me (f 16). I was with him for a year and almost 9 months. In that time both of my parents died and my only grandparent left. He was always there for me, but after my moms death(the most recent) he changed. He would just sit on craigslist when we hung out. I would try to get him to go places with me instead of sitting there, which he refused. He started fighting with me more, and calling my a bitch in every fight. Things weren't the same but i still loved the old him. So a week before we broke up he wouldn't touch me, hug me, kiss me, cuddle with me, he would avoid hanging out with me, and when i got naked in front of him and tried to get him excited he would just push me off.. I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what. Now I know that he was having other feelings for another girl, he didn't tell me this i had to find out the hard way. A couple of days before we broke up we got in a fight over text message while he was at work.. so i drove in there to say 'hey lets stop fighting i love you' Well he took me on a delivery and said 'You are ruining my social life' i said 'Well who do you want to hang out with' ' the girls from work, they asked me out drinking and i said no I cant because of kim' ok first of all when your in a relationship you should go out drinking with all girls...plus he hates drinking he would even do it with me. and hey here is an idea, you could always invite me. So after he told me that, i broke down on the way home, I always fuck everything up, I shouldn't be alive. So then we broke up, come to find out he had told his dad 'we were fuck buddies,' oh okay thanks..And also the day after we broke up he was texting the girl from his work that almost broke us up multiple times.. here are some other reddits i've posted right after the break up:  _URL_ I hate myself more and more everyday, because I was the problem..Now he blocked me on facebook, wont talk to me, wont check up on me(even tho I'm very suicidal) so he doesn't care about me, and I can see why.. But now I miss him more than ever, I have all of the stuff he gave me and last night I had a dream about how we used to be happy, I woke up crying. I know people will always say, its ok move on you'll find someone better.. Well when we were happy he was always looking forward to spending the future with me. I miss everything, all of the cuddling and when he used to make dumb faces. I miss all the passionate kisses. I miss the old him. Now I'm just lost, because I gave up all of my friends to be with him. He had made all of those friends when he got a job, and I just sit here alone. All the people I want to hangout with have girlfriends, and my best friend is a long ways away. I hate making new friends when I need someone because I feel needy. I miss him, but I'm the one who fucked up everything. All I do is sit at home, cry a lot, sometimes cut,  and I cant eat because I'll throw up. I'm better off dead, I just need to die, but I want him to find me..so then maybe he will miss me back..",1,4,637,recently broke year months time parents died grandparent left moms death recent changed sit craigslist hung places sitting refused started fighting calling bitch fight things loved week broke touch hug kiss cuddle avoid hanging naked front excited push knew wrong feelings girl find hard couple days broke fight text message work drove hey lets stop fighting love delivery ruining social life hang girls work asked drinking ca nt kim relationship drinking girls hates drinking hey idea invite told broke home fuck alive broke find told dad fuck buddies day broke texting girl work broke multiple times reddits posted break url hate everyday problem blocked facebook wo nt talk wo nt check tho suicidal care miss stuff gave night dream happy woke crying people move find happy forward spending future miss cuddling make dumb faces miss passionate kisses miss lost gave friends made friends job sit people hangout girlfriends friend long ways hate making friends feel needy miss fucked sit home cry lot cut ca nt eat throw dead die find miss back,16.0,29.0,9,10,5,17,11,18,4,9

153,"Okay well I don’t really like talking about myself but since you all are nice enough to read this I guess I'll share some personal things with you guys…I don’t know how to really start but I guess I’ll try by explaining my various issues…The number one issue for my depression is that I hate myself, so in other words, my low self-esteem. I look in the mirror and see the reflection and I’m just disgusted. I’m ugly, fat, stupid, and their is no one who could ever like a person like me.I’ve cut for the past four years of my life off and on. It has gotten significantly worse these past two years though. I used to cut maybe once of twice a week, and now its almost everyday.I think about killing myself everyday. Every morning when I wake-up, if something bad happens during the day, and before I go to bed. Before I fall asleep at night I pray that I won’t wake-up in the morning. That all the pain and all the suffering will be over, and I’ll be gone. The people in my life will move on and act as if I was never here. No one will care, and everyone’s lives will be a lot easier. My parents, my few _PERSON_ you can even call them that), and my boyfriend. I’ve had multiple attempts aswell. Planned it all out, left suicide notes, ready to do it, but well as you can see, unfortunately I’m still alive.My number two reason is my mother…She blames me for ALL the stress in her life…She blames me for things that happen at her office, like if one of her employee’s fuck up she’ll compare me to them and say that I’m just like them!She calls me stupid, lazy, worthless and that I’ll never amount to anything in life.If she doesn’t like the clothes that I’m wearing she’ll tell me I look like a prostitute…She blames me for her having _PERSON_ I’m sorry I fucking shoved sugar down your throat….?!)The number three reason is that my parents put a lot of restrictions on me. I’m 18 and I’m not allowed to go anywhere. Even if I want to go see a movie or go for coffee with one of my friends I have to ask for permission, which is pointless because they always say no anyways.I get no independence. I get no life. They suffocate me. I HAVE to work in their office; I am not allowed to get any other job. This is so they can keep an eye on me, and see what I am doing at all times. I am not allowed to take my cell phone to work or keep it in my room when I get home. I forgot to mention that I pay for this phone myself.My number four reason is my boyfriend. I care and love him a lot so don’t get me wrong or anything, but I just feel like I’m always doing something wrong in our relationship, or I’m stressing him out with all my “drama”. I just feel like he wants to break-up with me. He constantly tells me that this is not the case and that he does not want a break-up. I just feel like he deserves someone better than me. Someone who’s smarter, prettier, and will give him everything he wants/needs in a relationship.I just don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I don’t know where I’m going or what is going to happen to me.

170,"So.My roommate had a breakdown Thursday night.  She's been having a difficult semester emotionally, but nowhere near as bad as anyone realized.So Thursday night, five people sat up in our room with her as she sobbed and threatened suicide and explained her plan (to certain people, while trying to hide it from others).  Eventually, the massive amount of alcohol in her system got the better of her, and she fell asleep.  We were able to notify Proper Authorities that she was threatening suicide, that she had a plan, and that she claimed to be intent on acting upon it.  She was required to be assessed at our counseling center.  We were able to leave to go to bed around 5am.Friday during the day, she showed no remorse.  She was mad at us for taking her alcohol, she was upset that we had gotten the dean involved, she was adamant that she would lie at her counseling appointment that day (and she did), and she was defending her right to kill herself.  This was the last straw for me--I called her mother.  The hope was that she would spend Friday night with the mother in a hotel room, spend the weekend at home, and come back with an Eye Opening Experience.We were wrong.  Repeat of Thursday night, but with less suicidal threatening and more crying.  She refused to see the mother.  She said that we all thought her feelings were stupid and we were judging her for feeling this way.  We all asserted that she was the only one saying she was stupid, and that we just wanted to help but we didn't know what to give her.(BTW, the thing she insists she needs is her ex-boyfriend back, but he broke with her because she was codependent and abusive and is specifically avoiding contact so that she has to get help.  The problem is much, much bigger than the boyfriend, but she pins the burden of everything on his _PERSON_ anyway.  We finally got her to sleep around 5AM Saturday morning, and I went to bed hoping to keep an eye on her.  At 7AM, she woke up (I was out like a light, hadn't slept at all the night before) and broke a bottle of Bacardi 151 in the shower.  I woke up around 7:30 to the sound of her sobbing, and literally pulled a bottle of vodka out of her hands, and we talked until 9:30AM.  She finally agreed that she would be willing to go with me to a hospital with a psychiatric unit to get assessed later today, but on the condition that her ex boyfriend show up for a while.  He did not pick up his phone (good on him), I watched her as she sobbed herself back to sleep, saying she would do nothing but stay in bed and that she would not be willing to go talk to someone.And then I called the mom back.  I'm sorry, but when I am pulling a bottle of vodka out of someone's hands at 7:30 in the fucking morning, I am not prepared to be cautious and sensitive.  The mother and I spoke, and we spoke to a crisis center, and we spoke to a representative from the dean, and we came up with a list of options for my roommate.  1 was to go voluntarily to a hospital with the mother.  They got worse from there.After a half-hour confrontation, the roommate agreed to go to a psych unit, on the condition that afterwards the mother leave immediately (because of course she was fine and she would be released).  She was furious at me for calling the mother, for officially reporting the first suicidal incident, and for generally being a tattle-tale.Now, she's been told she can be released on the condition that she does not consume alcohol and she can find someone willing to spend the night with her and keep her safe.  Sorry, we're not putting up with it a third night in a row.  The mother said that she will stay with her daughter (which I think is fine), and would even get them separate but  adjacent hotel rooms, but the roommate is having none of this.  She's currently trying to get someone to ""be there for her,"" but I think we (the friends) are presenting a pretty unified front on this in that she's called each of us, in turn, and we've all said that we think she needs professional help, not a friend to enable her.  I've also talked to ""the team"" privately, and we all agree that we don't think we can afford to show her a third night in a row that she can get all the affirmation she wants (and needs!) by just making agonizing demands on us.  We need sleep, we need peace, we need to be able to take care of ourselves and each other.So.  In the morning, I will have my roommate back.  She will be furious at me, for abandoning her to either spend the night with her mother or in a hospital.  She will be furious at everyone, but I live with her.  I do not feel safe leaving her alone at night, but I also do not have the emotional reserves to fight with her over my decisions, nor to stay up, unable to sleep, as she sobs all night.  I know I was right.  I feel completely justified for calling in professionals, and for ""abandoning"" her to ""the only people who can help her get better, instead of just making her feel better"".I'm wondering, I suppose, how I proceed from here so that I can actually have my own life this semester.  Perhaps it was a bad move, but I did all of her laundry for her (one manifestation of her depression has been that she has not done a single load of laundry all semester, and my room smelled like someone vomited up a yeast infection and there were molding, shrunken apple cores among her dirty panties, and I'm sorry if that was not the right thing to do to empower her but *I just could not continue to live like that*), cleaned all the mold and mildew up from her side of the room, and made her bed for her.  I've cleaned the broken glass from the bathroom, and I'm prepared to spend as much or as little time with her as she wants.  I just don't know what to actually...do.  I don't know if it's the right thing to do to defend myself against her or if I just let her talk and empathize.  I don't know if I glue myself to the room so she never gets any alone time or if I back off and give her the room to herself a few nights a week.  I don't know if I openly talk to her about her abuse of her prescribed pills (she has adderal and amphetamines), or the fact that she said her plan was to kill herself with those and alcohol.  Am I allowed to do roommate-things with her, like ask her to take out the trash, or am I just walking on eggshells until Christmas?  What do I do if she's just really sad and crying all night and I can't sleep, or if she (as she did last night), wanders out of the room with a bottle and I have to run after her to bring her back in?  How do I make sure she's safe without giving up my own freedom?

174,"Back in 2009, my mom was fired from her job after working there for a decade. It was over some HIPAA privacy issues. A coworker, lets call her _PERSON_ mentioned that _PERSON_ had a UT problem. She then non-maliciously looked it up using her professional access. She's been around these people for a decade, they worked together in a close-proximity, and they are very close emotionally, so something personal like this wouldn't be an issue among them. However, some trouble-making person, lets call her _PERSON_, told a higher up and because of this technical infraction, she had to be fired. I don't think she understands that it was a pure technicality, in fact I know she doesn't understand that. I used to go to her job when I was in elementary and middle school when I had to do surveys and interviews for school. They are a professional sisterhood. So for some reason or another, she has taken the firing personally and still believes it is some character fault of hers or something. No one wanted her gone, except for _PERSON_, not even the boss that fired her.I helped her find another job less than a year later where she has been working ever since. Her effervescent personality had survived the firing and she has talked about her days at her new office often over the years. She laughs as she tells us about notable events and personalities at the office. It has been that way since 2009, but I've always suspected that underneath all the laughter she is still depressed. She has mentioned a few times over the years that she thinks about jumping in front of the train (I live in a major city). And she mentioned it again today while my parents have been having a little quarrel.This is what I don't get. Neither of these events were/are personal, but she takes it personally. She doesn't work in an administrative capacity, so she can't feel responsible for the establishment closing. We have been financially worse when I was younger so it can't be a shocking change. Even when she had no job for a period of seven months, we didn't have any serious financial burdens. We are better off today since my brother also has a career now. I don't know of any practical difference since her departure from her first job, and I doubt there will be any practical difference this time around. In regards to the current situation, maybe I'm too young to understand how an establishment's financial failure can have such an emotional impact unless I myself have emotionally invested a great deal on its success (like if it was my own business). Does a job ending have the same impact regardless of the reasons surrounding its end? That seems silly.She doesn't walk around listlessly either. Occasional moping, but every human does that. My family on the whole is humorous and we share laughs often. My dad is a little abrasive, but there is love between them. We are a pretty emotionally healthy family. I don't communicate personal things, like my distaste of their religious beliefs, or other things, but how many young adults can?I don't doubt that what she feels and has expressed is real to her, but when I think about it, I have no empathy for her reasoning. None of her job issues have been personal, so who cares? And this is why I feel bad. I do not have any sympathy and it scares me. And losing her would confuse me.

176,"Nights have always been the worst for me. Occasionally things will get bad during the day, but night is usually when it crops up.I feel torn on being here tonight. I'm a fiercely independent person, and scrabbling around for bits of help from Internet strangers runs deeply counter to that. I feel like I'm wasting people's time, chewing up attention, being melodramatic... like there's other people out there who are in serious imminent danger of hurting themselves who deserve the help more than I do.

I feel like no matter what I do, nobody will want to be around the real me. So I lie. I'm a damned good liar. But that's just one more reason why I can't accept the idea that someone would be able to tolerate me - if people knew how much I distort the truth, how could they possibly put up with the strain of constantly wondering if I'm being honest?I've *almost* resigned myself to the strong possibility that I will carry out the rest of my life alone, just as I am now.

177,"I don't even really know what to say anymore.A big part of me hates complaining about things, for a number of varied reasons. So it's hard to come here and just whine and bitch for no real purpose. Unfortunately, I feel like that's the best recourse I have right now.Everyone I know is either asleep or too busy to get involved. It figures that the one time that is really hard for me (nights) has to overlap directly with the time when the fewest people are available to be there. When it's easy for people to help, I don't need it; but when it requires going a little bit out of their way, they won't do it, and naturally that's when I'm the most desperate. The feelings of despair and abandonment just feed themselves on this irony.I feel like I lack the energy and desire to continue fighting. I'm still cycling between deep depression and hypomania, often within the space of a few hours. It's so exhausting. Worse, it's virtually impossible to treat with medication - the drugs take far too long to kick in and address only one half of the equation. The best I can do is ride it out. There's no hope for eliminating the symptoms entirely; I'll be stuck with this pattern for the rest of my life.Sure, I may have periods of stability and lucidity; I may go for months at a time with no problems, as I did earlier this year. But looming in the back of my mind is the constant reminder that someday I'll have to go through it all again - the aching, the anger, the fear, the rush, the buzz, the high, the cutting, the self-medicating, the long nights of trying to talk myself out of hospitalization or even being fully committed.I am so very tired of this. Even as I sit here, wide awake against my wishes and full of energy, I'm drained past the point of being empty. I haven't just given it all I've got - I'm in debt. And I have no idea how to find my way back to stability and normalcy.I've started making my final plans. I'm working on a checklist of all the loose ends I want to tie up before I go, and all the people I need to write to. I know how devastating it will be when I finally check out. I'm under no illusions that this will make things better for anyone but me. Call me selfish if you want; if ending the most miserable state of existence I can fathom is selfish, then so be it - I'm an asshole. But isn't it just as selfish for everyone else in my life to demand that I stay in this state forever, just so they can avoid the pain of losing me? Who is really making the more selfish demands here?Some of my friends need to know what they've done to help - because they *have* helped. A few others need a swift kick in the ass for being more or less useless. My family is probably the hardest one; despite their misguided attempts to drown me in religion as a cure for all this, they at least care enough to *try* something.

178,"I almost posted this using my normal account, because part of me really wants it to be known what's going on. I really can't fully justify my decision to remain anonymous; it does interfere with the possibility of someone directly being able to assist in the situation. But anything is better than nothing, and I'm facing some scrutiny at the moment for new-job-purposes, so I don't need this crap of all things showing up and complicating matters.The truth is, I'm skating a fine and dangerous line in my life at the moment, and the excess pressure has built to the point where it needs to vent or I'll rupture some capillaries in some vital location. Ordinarily this is the kind of thing you take to your friends. Or your family. Or your religious compatriots. Or whatever. This is not the sort of shit which is appropriate, normal, or healthy to unload in public to a bunch of strangers on a medium like the Internet. Chances are this little nugget is going to haunt me for a long time [or would have if I'd attached my real name to it].But I'm well past caring, and deeply reckless at the moment. So I'm gonna do it anyways, and you get to point and laugh. Win/win, right? Everyone loves a hit of schadenfreude.My friends are, to a person, in no position to do anything at this point. My family doesn't need any extra baggage to cope with either. I find no particular appeal in sitting in a dark wooden booth talking to a priest, for a number of reasons, not least of which being that I'm an atheist and place no stock in the mental competence of the professional clergy. There's always doctors, but they're expensive, and even the good ones don't make house calls at 2:30 AM. Short of buying a stuffed ostrich and seeking its counsel, I'm low on alternatives, although one could make a pretty good case that talking to a toy bird is less insane than journaling about this on the web.It's hard to contextualize a weekend in which you've alternated - more times than can be counted - between feeling like the second incarnation of the Christ and seriously pondering chambering a round and finding out if you'll have enough remaining milliseconds of consciousness hear the sound of your own grey matter covering the walls. There are points where the two just overlap, and in some twisted psychological paradox, you hate yourself for being so happy and are overjoyed at being so miserable.To be sure, they make medication for this. I have a really nice prescription for some of it (four of them, in fact). But there's a minor problem here known as non-compliance. Some people have reasons for not popping their daily dose. I don't. One of the most deeply frustrating aspects of my condition is the fundamental conflict between my pragmatic, analytical nature and my refusal to expend a minimal amount of effort every morning to stave off the onset of what is likely the most traumatic and terrifying mental experience a human being can ever endure. There is no rational reason - hell, not even a poorly supported, emotional, irrational reason - for metaphorically playing Russian Roulette with a semi-automatic, and yet here I sit, staring down the maw of pathological chronic psychosis... and twenty feet away on the counter lies an unfilled prescription dated sometime in January.I'd be lying if I told you that I don't love every minute of it. There is a thrill to flirting with this that is unlike any adrenaline addiction in the world. The fact of the matter is, I look forward to it. There is no drug that can touch this. Words flow; I can't write like this ""normally."" Code flows, too; my most inspired and beautiful creations are spawned from the primordial ooze of psychological pandemonium. I write my best music at times like these.Sure, there's irritability, short term memory loss, all the side effects of chronic sleep deprivation, and of course the actual life consequences of all the monumental stupidity one commits when in this state. It's tough to explain the twelve parallel scars on your forearm, for instance. I presume it's just as tough to explain why you were doing 120MPH down the interstate, although I have yet to actually be forced to account for that particular idiocy.But none of that matters. All that's important is riding the high, staying blitzed out of your mind, wringing every last drop of maniacal pleasure out of the tortured and rapidly fraying rag of your life. The stupidity is eclipsed by an all-consuming hedonistic obsession. If it feels good, do it to obscene excess. I don't normally drink much, but my liquor supply is dwindling at an alarming rate these days. I don't think I've smoked as much in the past five months as I have in the last five days. There's some suspiciously fist-shaped dents in the walls now, which correspond in interesting ways with the occurrence of thirty-hour Halo marathon sessions. (Some of those dents are celebratory, but mostly they're the lingering testament to unremembered episodes of blind rage. Depends on how many games I won and how many I lost.)If I weren't socially dysfunctional and living the middle of the most ass-backwards conservative part of the country, I'd probably be treading water right next to Hank Moody in his proverbial sea of pointless pussy. To be honest I'm not sure if I'm more annoyed or relieved that I'm not on a rampant sex binge right now; God knows I more or less have substituted testosterone for all my blood at this point. Probably best to keep the destructive chaos of my problems confined to myself, I suppose... no sense in ensnaring some poor innocent chain of women in my disintegrating mass of lunacy. (I daresay they might find the experience worth it, but I can only justify that argument by breaking into some truly lurid speculation at what I'd do with a suitably attractive female and her delicious little body right now; and this is SW, not some trashy erotic fiction board, and in any case I'm so delusional right now that it's probably not true anyways.)Of course all this raises an important question: why am I here in the first place? I don't even know if I want help. I'm fairly sure that I'm running entirely on id at this point and all I really am after is attention. (OK, let's be honest. I want some gorgeous young thing to read this and fall hopelessly head over heels for my prose, be deeply moved by my emotional plight, and make it her dedicated life goal to cure all my worldly ailments by means of frequent raunchy sex.)But it felt good to say all this, and in a weird sort of way, it'll feel good to think that someone read it. Even if nobody really does.Because right now, the anonymous, faceless internet seems to offer more in the way of genuine interest and compassion than all the individuals I can name put together. I'm also deep in a rut of ignoring the advice and care of everyone around me anyways, as if somehow it only counts if it comes from someone who doesn't know me for real. I have no idea if the people in my life actually do give a shit or not, although I have to confess that the patterns indicate a gut-wrenching trend of them running for the hills as soon as I start getting weird. (Fuck you, _PERSON_, by the way. You're a low-down liar and you nearly cost this world a precious life because of it. If I could bring my broken heart to wish upon you a greater misfortune than having to live out your life drenched in the guilt of what you did to me, I would.)When it comes down to it, I've always sort of idolized the Hollywood image of the battered, scarred hero, shrouded in bandages and comatose in some anonymous hospital bed. It's as close as you can get to actually seeing who shows up (and who cries) at your own funeral. I guess I just want the satisfaction of knowing that someone would really be broken up if I decided it was time for an experiment in lead-powered trepanation.And hell, if the silver screen can be trusted, we all know that the ladies dig guys with incurable diseases. At least, I hope so, because that way my sorry ass might actually find someone who gives a fuck someday.And with that, I think I've indulged myself enough, and certainly probably lost your interest a long time ago anyways.

179,"I feel like a goddamn fixture in this joint.Maybe it's therapeutic. God knows I need the therapy, in pretty much any form I can find. Maybe it's just shameless attention whoring. I'm not going to lie, it's kind of cool to labor under the illusion that someone on this shitty rock cares about you for a few hours. Then of course I remember that it's just reddit and nobody hear really knows anything about me, and I can curl back up into the warm comfort of my eternal self-loathing and despair.Don't let me stop you, of course; when you say nice things about me, both of us feel better. You probably moreso than me. Just understand that I'm going to believe you for all of a fraction of a happy second, and then go back to being convinced that the universe would be vastly improved after my removal from it.A few days ago I was in here raving up a storm about all kinds of things. That's mania for you. To be frank, I only posted that because I knew that this time was coming. I knew that the high would pass and leave in its wake the utter despondency and misery of depression. It always happens this way.I wanted to get back in the habit of lurking around SW, because I knew that sooner or later the piper would come round with his smartly printed invoice, and demand his due. Well... bitch didn't just come for the rent money, bitch brought the pimp and the posse. I used to think the Mafia had some great lien-less collection methods (kneecapping comes to mind) but this crowd could make _PERSON_ happily proclaim to be an atheist.In short... I find myself back in the place I've visited so many times before. Back in that delectable little spot that subsumes all light and hope in a way that ""black"" just can't begin to describe. My trusty _PERSON_ knife is waiting for me across the room, begging in a sensuous sort of way to reignite our old passions and spill that blood just one more time. And in all fairness, the scars _are_ starting to fade a bit... and I wouldn't want them to get lonely.Knives are for amateurs, though. Why lay around in a puddle of your own neglect and hatred, waiting for someone to inevitably notice and call 911? Why give fate the chance to fuck you over one last time, and deprive you of the one thing that would satisfy?I believe in doing things once, and doing them right. Don't leave room for questions or mistakes or second thoughts.All I really want to know is whether or not I'd have the chance to see the flash, hear the sound, feel the rapid exit of brain from cranium as the bullet wends its oblivious way into the wall behind me. I'd be rather disappointed if the lights just went out with no fanfare.My only regret would be that I wouldn't live long enough to really absorb the understanding of what it means to be dead.There's a practical dilemma, of course, and that is not so much the selection of the _type_ of tool, but which _particular_ one. My 9mm pistol is a beautiful piece of art and would make a very ergonomic (albeit somewhat cliche) means of settling matters. But I certainly don't want to neglect the assault rifle, either; it's an elegant and powerful creation all its own, and bears more than a little sentimental value.My most difficult choice right now involves determining which of my weapons I want to disappoint by _not_ choosing it to silence the maelstrom of agony. Too bad I'm not coordinated enough to shoot myself with both at the same time.You're already preparing the same trite old response that gets recycled like so much newspaper around here. Don't do it. There's good in the world, stuff that's worth living for. It would hurt too many people, more than one might imagine. Taking yourself from this realm would constitute a tragic loss for us all._PERSON_.I'm a gangrenous limb. Better to be amputated and save the innocent remainder of the body from inevitable death by infection than to prolong the agony and pain over a little bit of sentimental attachment. Cauterization is ugly, but ultimately it spares that which remains from a fate worse than a scar.If there really is good in the world, keep it for yourselves. At least that way someone will be able to enjoy it. I'm beyond that. In the rare cases when something good has been within my grasp, I've stopped at nothing to banish it from my presence with as much haste and hate as I can muster.I'm in the final stages of negotiation for a new job. Double the salary, ridiculous benefits, vastly improved career prospects. I have good friends, good people. A family. Nice car. Own a house. No outstanding debt (aside from the mortgage) and no substantial criminal record. Nothing to run from, nothing to bury and hope to never revisit. By most standards, I'm pretty successful.It's wasted.I hate all of it, I resent everyone, and the few people crazy or genuinely decent enough to get involved in my life are inevitably told to go die in a fire, because I'm terrified of anyone actually caring about me. Such a delicious contradiction... the only thing I want is to feel like I matter to someone, and yet I'll stop at nothing to make myself as onerous and hateful as I can. I refuse to let anyone provide the one thing that would do me any good.I crave the involvement of the perfect woman, someone to be strong for me when I cannot be strong for myself, to care and listen and advise and just exist when those things are necessary. I ache for someone I can cherish for her inner and outer beauty, for all the things that make us so perfect and imperfect and irredeemable and invaluable as human beings. And I am terrified for the inescapable moment when I would lie awake at night, arms around her, smelling the hint of recently visited surf on her midnight hair, look into those eyes like pine needles through morning fog... and hate her for loving me.I'm beyond help, beyond hope, and I want to be told that I am wrong so I can laugh at your hollow consolation and retreat ever further into the certainty of my worthlessness.I will captivate and exploit every precious second of your attention that I possibly can, by weaving words in the only way I know how, and I will loathe you for listening to my pretentious drivel. I will spend hours polishing every last turn of phrase so I can detest you for being impressed by my oratory. I will spill out every drop of my soul onto the unfeeling tarmac and mock you for empathetically trying to turn the stains back into a person who once was whole.I will post a litany of disgusting prose to SuicideWatch, and I will reject and deflect every response I get, knowing that every best attempt at helping me will serve only to make me more convinced that I am beyond any help.And I will secretly hope that none of that will stop you.Because I will secretly hope that one of you will find it in you to stop me.",1,12,1234,feel goddamn fixture joint therapeutic god therapy pretty form find shameless attention whoring lie kind cool labor illusion shitty rock cares hours remember reddit hear curl back warm comfort eternal loathing despair don stop nice things feel moreso understand fraction happy back convinced universe vastly improved removal days ago raving storm kinds things mania frank posted knew time coming knew high pass leave wake utter despondency misery depression wanted back habit lurking sw knew sooner piper round smartly printed invoice demand due bitch rent money bitch brought pimp posse mafia great lien collection methods kneecapping mind crowd make person happily proclaim atheist short find back place visited times back delectable spot subsumes light hope black begin describe trusty person knife waiting room begging sensuous sort reignite passions spill blood time fairness scars starting fade bit lonely knives amateurs lay puddle neglect hatred waiting inevitably notice call give fate chance fuck time deprive thing satisfy things don leave room questions mistakes thoughts chance flash hear sound feel rapid exit brain cranium bullet wends oblivious wall disappointed lights fanfare regret live long absorb understanding means dead practical dilemma selection type tool mm pistol beautiful piece art make ergonomic albeit cliche means settling matters neglect assault rifle elegant powerful creation bears sentimental difficult choice involves determining weapons disappoint choosing silence maelstrom agony bad coordinated shoot time preparing trite response recycled newspaper don good world stuff worth living hurt people imagine taking realm constitute tragic loss person gangrenous limb amputated save innocent remainder body inevitable death infection prolong agony pain bit sentimental attachment cauterization ugly ultimately spares remains fate worse scar good world enjoy rare cases good grasp stopped banish presence haste hate muster final stages negotiation job double salary ridiculous benefits vastly improved career prospects good friends good people family nice car house outstanding debt mortgage substantial criminal record run bury hope revisit standards pretty successful wasted hate resent people crazy genuinely decent involved life inevitably told die fire terrified caring delicious contradiction thing feel matter stop make onerous hateful refuse provide thing good crave involvement perfect woman strong strong care listen advise exist things ache cherish outer beauty things make perfect imperfect irredeemable invaluable human beings terrified inescapable moment lie awake night arms smelling hint recently visited surf midnight hair eyes pine needles morning fog hate loving hope told wrong laugh hollow consolation retreat certainty worthlessness captivate exploit precious attention possibly weaving words loathe listening pretentious drivel spend hours polishing turn phrase detest impressed oratory spill drop soul unfeeling tarmac mock empathetically turn stains back person post litany disgusting prose suicidewatch reject deflect response knowing attempt helping serve make convinced secretly hope stop secretly hope find stop,69.0,78.0,42,44,32,38,42,39,27,40
180,"About ten feet away in my closet, there's an alluring collection of items that promises to solve everything. The key players include one AR-15 carbine in a hard-shell carrying case, four polymer magazines, and twelve rounds of 5.56 FMJ ammunition. The promise is a lie, but it doesn't matter how many times you tell yourself it's a lie if you still want to believe it.I could disassemble and reassemble that rifle blindfolded and in my sleep. I can land a ten shot group in an area the size of a quarter at twenty-five yards even without the assistance of the 9-power scope mounted on the upper rail. At a time when it feels like I've lost the mental capacity to do even menial tasks, when it takes more effort than I can summon just to change my socks, when I have no clarity to see even a few minutes into the future - this is all the comfort I have. I know that no matter how far my mind may be gone, how ruined and exhausted and broken my body may become, I will still have what it takes to make one final shot at point blank range.I have watched my life deteriorate rapidly over the past few weeks. All the patterns are there, so ingrained and familiar that I plunge into them unconsciously, utterly unaware of the progression until after it's too late. The medication has run out and I made no effort to secure a fresh prescription. The bills are piling up and the collections agencies have flooded my inbound calls list on my cell phone. I've carefully dismantled the very few supporting relationships I have left, alienating and driving away everyone who might be around to interfere with the decline. Everyone has been carefully manipulated and misdirected until they look the other way; even those who should know the warning signs are oblivious, because I've meticulously concealed the reality of the situation - or, sometimes, outright lied about it to divert their attention.This is not my first rodeo. I've warred with myself for the better part of 14 years, always swinging back and forth between wanting to be OK and wanting to plant a knife in my jugular. I've spent countless nights holding those knives, lying paralyzed on the floor and scrounging for any last ounce of resistance even as I tell myself over and over that all I want is to be done with the whole thing. Sometimes I'll pick one of my guns, take it apart, clean it, put it back together, rinse, repeat, hours of monotonous flirtation with the thing I want to do most and the thing I want above all to never do.It was supposed to get better. New treatments. New doctors. New home. New job. Fresh starts on all fronts, opportunities to succeed where I've destroyed myself before. I have no reason to want to quit life. No horrible past, no guilty conscience, no unspeakable trauma. I have no excuse for feeling this. Knowing that it makes no sense does nothing to calm the screaming agony that insists that I do not belong here. Knowing that it makes no sense simply removes all hope of finding a way to make life worth hanging on to.Above all else, I'm tired. Tired of fighting, resisting, hoping. Tired of clutching at the ribbons of the life I'm not even sure I want to keep. Tired of spending one day stubbornly surviving and the next day slicing new grooves into my arms. Tired of inwardly craving someone, anyone, to come along and care, while outwardly weaving a revolting image of someone that nobody could ever bring themselves to care about. Tired of feeling like I shouldn't bother reaching out for help, because I don't deserve to be helped.As with so many times before, being tired will probably be my salvation. I will fall asleep before I find the energy to accomplish my exit. And then I will feel even worse - for failing, for crying wolf, for wasting the time and concern and attention of anyone who happens to look in at the right moment. I will be back: at work, pretending nothing is wrong; at home, curled up on the floor in a dark room, alone with my twisted mind; here, begging for something I can't even name, and knowing that in all likelihood I will reject whatever is offered.I can't ignore the problem. I hate the thought of eroding away in an anonymous hospital. I'm not even sure I want to be OK anymore. I want out, and I have the ticket, but I don't have the crucial piece of whatever it is that would let me cash it in.Sometimes I feel pain. Sometimes I feel anger. Sometimes I feel loneliness, or guilt, or regret, or whatever else. But this time all I feel is desperation and deep disgust. I hate my reality and I hate myself for allowing it to become real. I hate staying alive and I hate the thought of being gone.I am a prisoner of my own mind, and the warden is cruel.I'm skeptical that anyone will read all of this, or bother to be moved on my behalf, or bother to reply even just to say that someone's paying attention. I don't feel like I'm worth any of that. I don't know what will happen, what I will do, how I will feel if and when I wake up tomorrow. I don't even know if I want this to improve.I don't know if I will hate myself more for posting this, or for deleting it and simply suffering in silence and anonymity.I am so lost in all of this. I will probably tell you that I don't want your help.Please don't listen.",1,6,964,ten feet closet alluring collection items promises solve key players include ar carbine hard shell carrying case polymer magazines twelve rounds fmj ammunition promise lie matter times lie disassemble reassemble rifle blindfolded sleep land ten shot group area size quarter twenty yards assistance power scope mounted upper rail time feels lost mental capacity menial tasks takes effort summon change socks clarity minutes future comfort matter mind ruined exhausted broken body takes make final shot point blank range watched life deteriorate rapidly past weeks patterns ingrained familiar plunge unconsciously utterly unaware progression late medication run made effort secure fresh prescription bills piling collections agencies flooded inbound calls list cell phone carefully dismantled supporting relationships left alienating driving interfere decline carefully manipulated misdirected warning signs oblivious meticulously concealed reality situation outright lied divert attention rodeo warred part years swinging back wanting wanting plant knife jugular spent countless nights holding knives lying paralyzed floor scrounging ounce resistance thing pick guns clean put back rinse repeat hours monotonous flirtation thing thing supposed treatments doctors home job fresh starts fronts opportunities succeed destroyed reason quit life horrible past guilty conscience unspeakable trauma excuse feeling knowing makes sense calm screaming agony insists belong knowing makes sense simply removes hope finding make life worth hanging tired tired fighting resisting hoping tired clutching ribbons life tired spending day stubbornly surviving day slicing grooves arms tired inwardly craving care outwardly weaving revolting image bring care tired feeling bother reaching deserve helped times tired salvation fall asleep find energy accomplish exit feel worse failing crying wolf wasting time concern attention moment back work pretending wrong home curled floor dark room twisted mind begging knowing likelihood reject offered ignore problem hate thought eroding anonymous hospital anymore ticket crucial piece cash feel pain feel anger feel loneliness guilt regret time feel desperation deep disgust hate reality hate allowing real hate staying alive hate thought prisoner mind warden cruel skeptical read bother moved behalf bother reply paying attention feel worth happen feel wake tomorrow improve hate posting deleting simply suffering silence anonymity lost listen,41.0,80.0,39,23,22,43,13,47,9,21
181,"I've confessed an awful lot here in the past. _PERSON_ things that I've never managed to elucidate anywhere else. Told whole truths instead of the carefully manipulated half-lies that everyone else hears. Revealed things that no one who knows me could even imagine. And yet there's so much more that remains unsaid, so many things concealed or only barely hinted at.Part of that is because I don't even want to confront the truth myself, let alone betray any hint of that truth to anyone else. I don't really know why; maybe it's embarrassment, maybe it's pride, maybe it's just another way to pretend that everything isn't as totally fucked up as it really is. But as things slide one more time into the gnawing dark... I have nothing left to lose. No reason to continue with the charade, no excuse to cower behind some facade of invented strength.Maybe by writing this I can accept what I'm so afraid of facing. Maybe I'll be proven wrong. In a few days, it won't matter either way.The truth is, I'm not strong. I'm not brave. I'm not a survivor. Every time I go through this, I go a little bit further. Every time I hurtle back down into the lightless abyss I want it to sting a little bit more. I don't want the pain to stop anymore. I don't want the demon that whispers in my own voice to be silenced. I want to succumb, to give in, to fold under the weight of all the dark things that have crowded out any semblance of hope.There are no words to communicate the depth of aloneness. Anyone who could have coined those words is already too far gone to carry them back to the realm of expression and understanding. I will follow them, soon, beyond the shapeless border that permits no re-entry. And then I, too, will be forever cut off from the chance to return to the place where real people live, forever without a means to share with any clarity what I have seen. So I will use the only words I have available, and hope that somehow they might capture some essence of the truth. I can't imagine what good it could do, but perhaps I will rest easier knowing that I've done all I could to explain myself. I know that no matter what I say, nobody will really understand why; nobody will be able to accept the simplicity of the decision. Maybe that's a good thing; no one should have to quietly shrug away the bitterness of this. So even if no one truly understands, at least I won't be able to blame myself for not telling them.I moved more than a dozen times growing up. I don't understand the concept of ""home"" that people talk about; the word has no meaning to me. The building I live in is just a convenient location to sleep in; the area I occupy is just another faceless abstraction. It could be anywhere, it could be nowhere; it wouldn't matter. My family is not close. The only person I know - the closest thing I have to the concept of a ""friend"" - is a guy I've known since first grade. He's a lying, selfish, inattentive, abusive son of a bitch. Most of the time I think his presence in my life does more harm than good.But in an existence dominated by constant and wildly uncontrollable change, he's a tiny sliver of stability. For a long time, I wanted something - anything - to be stable so desperately that I repeatedly looked the other way for all the years of mistreatment, neglect, and cruelty. The irony is that I can't even go to him with these problems. I despise him, resent him, and more often than not wish I could bring myself to let go of that island of certainty; what's the point of being sure of something when it's always negative?It shouldn't be much of a surprise that I'm very bad at interacting with people. Nobody knows that, because what I am good at is putting on a hell of a convincing show. Most people think I'm friendly, interesting, outgoing, funny... all they know of me is an act. I play the role of the likable guy that's thoroughly OK, and I play it well. But I am not, and never have been, that person.I spent the day goofing off and joking with my coworkers about how it's Friday and in a few hours we can go get a couple drinks and blow off steam for the weekend. I spent the day fantasizing about going home - not to break out the Scotch and watch some TV and unwind, but to lock myself in a dark room and suffer more. I used to enjoy my job; the last few days, I see it only as a way to burn a few hours until I can come back to my cave of pain and wallow in the catastrophic shit that has blocked out everything.For many years, I dreamed of romance. I wanted to meet someone who I could share life with, someone who could be a constant and help me establish the roots I've never had. As things worsened, I still had many of the same desires; but it was less about stability and certainty, and more about empathy. I just wanted someone who would always be there when I got home, someone who I could count on to smile gently and tell me everything's OK, someone to cry alongside me in the middle of the night when I lay awake in an exhausted heap of agony. Someone to hide the knives and guns and household toxic chemicals. Someone to be strong and carry me when my own strength gave out.Now... I am conflicted. Just imagining putting someone through that makes me feel guilty. At times, I don't feel like I deserve that kind of care; other times, I don't believe that anyone would willingly offer it. I certainly could never ask anyone to commit themselves to a life of that kind of hell, dealing with me day in and day out. And I could never get close to anyone without telling her the truth of what I am; it's bad enough that every outward facet of my life is a lie. I couldn't live with myself if I duped some poor innocent soul into getting tangled up in my world.There's still a lot of appeal in the idea. Every night, in the long moments between wakefulness and sleep, I can almost pretend that she's there. Almost imagine the reassuring warmth of her curled up beside me. Almost smell the hints of her. Almost hear her whisper that she loves me, that nothing can stop us, that I have a reason to live.Almost.Some nights I fall asleep this way. Some nights I carry on my helpless fantasy in a warped maze of half-coherent dreams. Every night I wake up again and realize that all of it is in my head, that my deluded cravings are so far from reality that they may as well join the ranks of the hallucinations and voices and grandiose obsessions. Sometimes I will spend interminable hours broken down to tears. Most of the time I'm just numb to the ludicrousness of it all, the pathetic desperate plea for something I know I will never have.When I'm really, truly honest with myself, I know I'd never accept it even if it were offered to me.My purpose in this world is to hurt, and to hurt alone. No mountain of reasoning or persuasion will convince me that I am wrong. I may pretend to change my mind for a time, may even allow some fraction of my mind to embrace the notion, but in the sturdiest foundation of my soul I will never believe that I could be loved. Not like that.What probably hurts the worst is knowing how much of a despicable, idiot child I must sound like even to say this. So naive, so ignorant, so obsessed with something trivial and trite, so bound by the knots of ugly self-loathing and self-pity and denial.A close runner up, though, is being told that I'm wrong. Happy people find it so damnably easy to promise that things get better, that you can find what you truly want in life, that it'll be OK. Stuck up in their insular, spotless ivory towers of not being fucked up and broken and ruined and worthless. Incapable of saying anything with meaning or believability. Good intentions mean nothing, no matter how genuine. They can reach out as hard as they like, but they will never be able to touch the reality of my situation. To do that, you have to be down here in the dark and the mud and the blood and the hurt.She's just a myth, a fantasy, an idea that once gave me something to look for and some reason to keep tolerating the world for another day. Now she's just an untruth that serves only to torment me more with the thought of what I cannot and will not have. The only purpose she serves is an obstacle. As long as she haunts me, I will never be free to leave this place in peace. Until I kill her, I cannot kill myself.I feel that I've stopped making sense, that I've rambled too long in self-indulgent tripe, that the sheer absurdity of what I have said cannot possibly merit any kind of response. I know how ridiculous and stupid and empty all of this is.But it's what I feel, and it's the truth. It's all I have left. I'm not asking for sympathy, or understanding, or caring, or anything really. I'm doing this for myself, because I will never be able to move on if I cannot admit the facts that sit before me.I don't know what comes next. I don't know if I'll feel better later, or worse, if I'll finally make good on the years of threats or if I'll miraculously dredge up yet another feeble excuse to keep on going.But I will fall asleep soon, drained and exhausted and bereft of any energy to deal with this any more for today.

182,"It's been a long time since I've wanted to drive a blade into my own flesh.The sensations return - long lost, yet still familiar and oddly comfortable, like an old jacket dug out of the back of a dusty closet. Everything is paradoxically darker than it should be. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. All I want to do is sleep until the discomfort goes away, but I find myself battling an increasingly resilient case of insomnia.I know this will never stop. My choices are either to live with the periodic suffering for the rest of my miserable existence, or to put an end to all of it and just rest forever... and judging by where I'm posting right now, it should be obvious that the latter is beginning to win the mental vote.My outward daily life is a carefully crafted sculpture of lies, designed to hide the reality of my world from everyone - sometimes even from myself. Tonight, the concealment is broken; perhaps not from anyone else, but I can't stay in denial any longer. I hurt, deeply and fundamentally, and pretending that it will just go away is going to solve nothing.Alienation and loneliness are essential ingredients in my world. It couldn't exist without them, and yet those very things are part of what drags my mind back into the downward spiral of yet another depressive episode. I can't tell people the truth. I've done that before with disastrous results. But I need _someone_ to know - someone besides the doctors, visited stealthily to avoid tipping off anyone else; someone besides the internet strangers, begged incessantly for support without results.I stood on my porch this afternoon, burning through a countless number of cigarettes for lack of anything useful to do with myself, and wondered what the fuck I'm even trying for.It's all just materialistic horseshit, and I don't care about any of it. The job, the hobbies, the recreation, the wasteful endless hours of meaningless idiocy that everyone seems content to call ""life"" - there's no goddamn point. I have no reason to do it, no investment in any of it. So what if some of it is occasionally fun? So what if it's lucrative? So what if society expects it?Fuck all of it, and fuck everyone who thinks it matters.I know what I really want, what would give me something to hang on _for_, what would provide desperately needed pause before pulling the trigger and violently redistributing my brain across the walls. I know this and I know I will never allow myself to have it - because I am terrified, because I am weak, because I have no hope and no will to try to attain it, and because the notion that anyone would stand by and provide it is a fucking lie.I'm too old, broken, hopeless, unappealing, repulsive, lazy, unmotivated, disenfranchised, bitter, scarred, angry, mistrustful, cynical, deceitful, cancerous.Nobody will ever give a shit because I refuse to let them.It doesn't get better. It just happens again. There isn't anything worth living for, because there's nothing worth dying for except for the beckoning call of permanent peace. Maybe some people would be hurt or surprised or inconvenienced or mildly distracted, who the hell knows, who the hell cares. Those people have some mystical genetic ability to ignore the fucked up nature of the universe and chug along as if happiness was a real thing, on a constant delusional treadmill of chasing the _PERSON_ and the next pay raise and the bigger car, and those people can collectively get fucked and die.Fuck your comforting, fuck your cajoling, fuck your pleas, fuck your sympathy, and fuck you.I'm going to go drink the last of the bourbon I have in the house, smoke my last two cigarettes, and if I have the presence of mind after all that, I'm going to put a stop to this shit.The roller-coaster may not be done with me, but I'm done with the roller-coaster.

183,"Going into my last year in high school's been tough, for about the past 6 years, the thought of killing myself has become more and more realistic.  starting off with the bad experience's would probably be a start I guess.  When I was about 5 until the time I was about 7, I was sexually abused by an older family friend, I had know what was going on the entire time and had developed a bit of a distrust to people at that point and have been shy since that day.  It's been pretty scaring for me to have to not open up to people really until now.Fast forwarding a couple years, constantly being bullied all throughout elementary/junior high school, even the start of high school.  I never felt quite in with the crowd and it made me distrust people more, become depressed and become pissed off with the world that I was living in.  I took to being friends with a few select people and constantly being an ass to others, due to the fact that I knew they were just trying to piss me off.  The situation at home was also very bad.  The only one in my household whom actually treated me with decency was my brother, whom to this day I have the best relationship with out of my entire family.  My parents were very violent and would constantly yell/beat me,  sometimes almost to the point of hospitalization/death.  I always hated living at home and vowed to either kill myself(which I have attempted many times before, couldn't follow through with it) or just live my life through and just move out ASAP and try to live life.  after my parents getting a divorce, things got much better for the beatings/violence,  mainly due to the huge custody battle my parents were in.  They tried to be as nice as possible and get me whatever I wanted(for the most part), yet all I wanted was an apology for their actions when I was younger and to truly accept me as their son.  neither would listen and continued to be completely ignorant.  To settle the whole custody arrangement, my parents thought it would be a good idea for me to go see a counselor to try to sort out my feelings.  During one of the counselor meetings, we were discussing a lot of things in the past, with arguments and how unfair my parents were.  My dad lied out his ass and tried to make him look like he was the victim the entire time, yet my mom had openly apologized for all the things she did and how she was wrong to take out her stress on us.  It was pretty much then that I moved in permanently with my mom.  That was about 2 years ago, since then, I had torn my ACL, as well as causing major meniscus damage  resulting in not being able to be active for the past year and a half, a very painful surgery, long term physiotherapy as well as depression.  I still cannot run properly or even play sports which was a big part of my life.

193,"Im posting this because I find myself thinking about suicide all the time. Im not really in any shit, but Ive become increasingly dissatisfied with my life and myself._PERSON_ warn you, this will be long and probably boring, but its things that Ive never told anyone. A lot of the information is useless but I just need to get it out of me somehow. I am 18 male and I come from a middle class american family (and a fucked up one at that). Its one of those American Beauty families where everything seems fine, but its really a giant clusterfuck of just... I dont even know. I was enslaved by christianity at birth by my narcissistic pastor dad, who treated my family like shit (of course he was respected in the church). When I came of age and started to understand him, I became extremely introverted and generally cruel to my family. I couldnt speak to them normally, I felt as if I had to hide any emotion I might feel, and speak as plainly and clearly as possible, and not do anything out of the ordinary, and avoid them as much as possible. This worsened and to this day I cant explain why I act like this. Now my parents are happily divorced, I dont speak to my dad and I live with my mom, who has to put up with my horrible attitude. Its such a wierd situation that my explaining cant do it justice.So basically its like this with my whole family, who think I am a joke because I seem to lack social skills and want to be a musician. So no love there. Never had a girlfriend, cant even say I want one, although I feel that it would help to have something to love and hold onto.These days my happiness comes when I listen to music. Beautiful music that reminds me of the life I really want to live. _URL_ If I had no family or friends, I would probably go live in the mountains for the rest of my life. I would live just outside of Gatlinburg, Tennessee in a campground, maybe work until I can build a small cabin up there and grow my own food. Ambitious, I know, but its fun to think about. The idea of escaping my life is intoxicating. I love to sleep and dream, and I spend a lot of time playing _PERSON_ and other games because it makes me feel separate for a little while.When depression comes, I start thinking about my place in this world. As if that wasnt challenging enough, then I start to think in terms of the universe. The truth is, nothing would change if I died. In the grand scheme of things, I would be another person out of billions that lived and died, to be buried and reclaimed by the earth, and eventually forgotten. I see myself in a hundred years as a bloated, dark corpse with my face eaten out my maggots, and I wonder, whats the point of doing anything at all if this is my true destiny? I understand that that is a stupid way to look at things, and that there are plenty of sources of joy and meaning in life to be tapped into, but I feel like I dont have access to them. I want to inspire someone, make someone dance and feel that warm joy that makes them so happy they want to cry. I feel as though I cant do this, like I lack the confidence and the individuality to influence someone else.Im in a band (I would post the link but I would lose anonymity, the band is called Naetiv if you really want to look it up) and it has actually become tedious. I used to love band practice and being able to sit down and write my own parts and fills (I play drums). Now I second guess everything I do, and frankly I think I look like an idiot when I play (stupid I know, but I take it to heart). When I see myself I see an awkward, self-conscious, spineless kid with no originality or vibe, Im pretty sure this is one of the main causes of my depression.Im sure many of you can relate to the deep, burning sadness that comes in spurts. The one that tears at your soul and physically shakes you. I wish there was an easier way out. If I were to kill myself I would probably tie some cinder blocks to my neck and torso, and jump into the river behind my neighborhood so no one would have to see me. I want to, the only thing keeping me from it is my family and the hope that things will get better, which I will hold onto as long as I can.Thank you for reading if youve gotten this far.

198,"I guess I just need to vent.. so here I go.Tonight I'm planning on hanging myself. I'm just so fed up with the game I created with my life. It just goes in circles; Bad, then on the way to get better, then something happens and I'm back to the beginning. I've been in therapy for a really long time and been hospitalized so many times. Don't get me wrong, my therapist is wonderful! All the shit in my life started in fourth grade, bullying. Getting kicked out of groups and left alone and called names like ""fat"",""ugly"", ""loser"", ""stupid"", etc. Same thing through the rest of my school experience. In 6th grade, I was raped multiple times. The guy is still out there and every time I remember I'm still at risk, I get an anxiety attack. (I have very bad anxiety). In 7th grade my teachers started bullying me too, they would tell me I'm an idiot and will never learn infront of the whole class, throw things at me, pull my hair, trip me, and once, they got together and beat me up. After the teachers showed the students that it's okay to beat me up, it became a regular thing for the kids. I got fed up, told the princepals, I even recorded a video of it on my iPod. I gave them my iPod over night for ""evidence"", next morning in the meeting with my mom, they say they never got any evidence. Never got my iPod back and was suspended for ""lying about the teachers"". My mom and dad never believed my depression or anger. They never believed that I got bullied, physically and verbally, even when I came home with black eyes and a swollen nose. They stopped talking to me for years and we still lived in the same damn house. I had to raise my little brothers because they were fucking lazy. I started cutting myself, burning, and hair pulling. Everyone said it was for attention, even though I did everything I could to hide it, deny it, and not acknowledge it. My mom started abusing me by forcing me to take off my clothes by threatnening to kill my brothers. In school, I was expelled for being caught crying in the bathroom. _PERSON_, why can't a girl be sad without getting punished? I started homeschooling. Everyday, I got over 200 texts from bullies. It was a nightmare. No one believed it was them cause they denied when approached and so the adults thought I was texting myself that stuff. My dad was always drunk and somewhere across the country. But I still loved both my parents very much for some reason. I finished my schooling at home, which destroyed any social skills I had left. My parents and relatives refuse to talk to me. I have no friends cause I can't talk to anyone except my therapist without getting anxiety. My only friend is my fucking therapist. Who I also am in love with, she doesn't know I'm a lesbian so she doesn't suspect anything. (After I got raped, I never felt secure around guys again). But she's leaving me. She hasn't answered my texts or calls for weeks, and won't say anything to me in our weekly sessions. I cry over her every night. When she does talk to me, she tells me she is tired of listening to my problems, and that she doesn't want anything to do with me. I'm not ready to let go of her. She's all I had left...Throughout the years I just explained to you, I attempted suicide 6 times. This time I hope it's for real. NO one would notice if I just disappeared, I probably wouldn't even have a funeral. I'm lonely, depressed, self harming, and I'm done. Anyway, thanks for reading my shit, I really needed to get this out, but I don't feel it changed my mind about ending my life tonight.TL;DR: Planning on hanging myself tonight cause I was bullied, raped, abused, raised my brothers cause of dead beat parents now none of my family/relatives will talk to me, I have no social life due to anxiety, and the woman of my life, (I'm a lesbian), is now leaving me in a harsh way.

201,"Some days I find it hard to keep going. My only motivation is to give people the opportunity to live through medicine. I often find myself wondering when the day comes and I save someone will it ever be enough to fill that void in my life. It is weird to think that a place of death gave way to a dream. The dream that one day I will be a surgeon. “Pippin: I didn't think it would end this way. Gandalf: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path... One that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass... And then you see it. Pippin: What? Gandalf?... See what? Gandalf: White shores... and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise. Pippin: [smiling] Well, that isn't so bad. Gandalf: [softly] No... No it isn't.”	I believe that the biggest wrong that any one person can give to another or themselves is regret. The regret that enough time wasn’t spent or words were not said. I assure you that no amount of time or togetherness will prepare you for death. How do I know? It’s simple, let me tell you. 	“Can you hear me, dad?” echoed throughout my father’s bare room. His fingers were that of ice and his eyes knew that the inevitable was coming. “Hurry the fuck up!” I shouted at the EMT who seemed every bit of shocked as I was. As they were grabbing the oxygen tank I rubbed my knuckles against my dad’s chest and looked into his eyes and a tear was forming. A tear of sadness? Maybe. I believe that it was a tear of joy, joy knowing that his death would lead to such an astounding goal. “We’re going to Florida in two weeks, just hang in there.” I whispered to my dad as I got off the bed and looked around. I have often read that you can feel when someone has passed; it’s not so much despair as it is relief. A relief knowing all the pain, confusion, and unknown are gone. 	“It’s your entire fault! If you wouldn’t have divorced dad we would have gotten him here sooner!” I shouted to my mother. The fate of my father was internally known amongst us all but denial had us believing that everything would be fine. An hour later we were led back to the consolation room. Feeling the tension and the amount of grief that was about to hit us I made a joke, I can’t remember what it was, but it brought laughter. Shortly after the physician walked into the room and said the words we all dreaded, the words that are burnt into my mind. “We pushed all the drugs that we could and got him back shortly but his body burned through them shortly after. I am terribly sorry for your loss.”	Without thinking I headed right for the door but I was held back and told to not do anything stupid. We left the consultation room and went outside. I was approached and asked if I would like to see my father. I was given a few words of warning that I can leave and remember my dad the way he was. The door opened slowly and I felt my blood boil as I saw my father’s lifeless body. I turned away quickly, looked up, and clenched my fists as tight as they could be. The _PERSON_ station was in front of me and with tears in my eyes I saw them looking at me, a look of heartbreak. I wanted so badly to start hitting the station and tell them all to fuck off but I knew that my father would be incredibly displeased with that so I ran outside. I could hardly catch my breath as I called my mentor, “Dad is gone.” After that everything was silent and I felt my mind start to shut down and just carry me without emotion through the next couple days. 	Approaching my grandparents at my father’s viewing I was overcome with sadness my eyes started to well with tears and I told them I did the best I could. I did the best I could to save my father. Did I, though? This is where all of the doubts come creeping in and engrave themselves into your brain and you can’t shake them. I was sitting in the front of the chapel by myself and I felt a hand on my shoulder. I look over and it is my mother. She starts talking to me and she says, “I miss him.” Yeah fucking right, is that why you divorced him? I told her that she needs to promise me to stop seeing the man she is. She asks why so I tell her that dad was the perfect person for her and she fucked it up and needs to be alone like he was. She says, “But he makes me laugh.” He makes you laugh? You have the gall to sit there in front of my dead father and talk about another man like that? I storm off. Later that night I let my anger get the best of me and I wrote my funeral speech. I was going to tell everyone that wronged my dad that they could go fuck themselves! Right there in front of everybody. I could hardly sleep that night as I was “day dreaming” the whole thing. I would walk up in front of everybody get on the microphone and praise my father for how amazing he was and  in the same breathe make everybody feel like they were the reason he was gone because of how terrible this last year was on him. Yeah, that’ll help me cope. Right?	It’s morning, finally. Today is the day that I will tell them all off! They all were shit to him and they should all see what they have done. I walked up the church steps and stood in the doorway I noticed I hadn’t tied my tie yet. Surprising, I normally do that as soon as I put a dress shirt on.  I fumbled with my tie for a while and no matter how much I tied it I couldn’t get it right. I’m at my father’s funeral and all I am thinking is, “I need to be a man now and I can’t even fucking tie this thing!” I finally had someone assist me with it and walked away into a corner and shed a few tears, I felt embarrassed. I gather myself and go stand near the door to greet the people that are coming in. I see some prominent people from our town and soon the door is getting crowded and people just pile keep piling in. People were giving me their condolences and telling me how I looked like my father. Like my father? I am starting to think about my speech and how I am going to condemn these people and they are telling me how great my father is and how he would be proud at the man I am becoming. Fuck! Everybody is now in the church and we are escorted to the front of it. I glance back and see people standing, the church wasn’t big enough. If only my dad could see this. The funeral proceeds and it comes time for me to talk. I walk up and look out onto the crowd. I pull my speech out of my pocket and slide my glasses up my nose like my father often did. “Do I look like my dad yet?” They all laughed and in that moment I realized this is a celebration of a life not a roast to these people. “I have a few words to say but I won’t be reading the speech, it is going to be between me and my father.” I babble on for about five minutes and then I look at my mother. I see how she is sitting there and I think about the exchange we had the other night at the viewing and without thinking I said, “I know what the records say but my father died at home with his sons and he died of a broken heart.” _PERSON_. 	I walked off the stage and sat down next to my brother and he said, “Good job man. You said what needed to be said.” Did I need to say it, though? I start to sob to myself as the music keeps playing and people are talking about how great my father was. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are multiple people here who owe their life to, _PERSON_. He was one of the best I’ve ever worked with and he will be missed.” The funeral has now ended and we need to carry the casket to the hurse. There will never be an object that is heavier than a casket is physically and mentally for a human. This is where your loved one rests.

My parents don't fight much or abuse me, I have had a boyfriend for six months, I live in a nice house, and I can afford some of the things I want (but don't necessarily need), and I have great friends. However, I feel completely dead to the world. I feel like that I have no connections with people, especially my friends and parents (my boyfriend is the closest one I have, but even to him, I feel disconnected sometimes). I feel that I have no meaning to be in this world. Everyone else seems to have their priorities straight, but I can't seem to find a meaning for me to be here. Also, I feel that I can never do anything right. I have noticed that this could stem from my family. At home, when I do chores and such, I get yelled at because it's not good enough (Mom has OCD). I have told my parents 3 times in the past 4 months that I think I'm depressed and that I have been contemplating suicide, but they never do anything about it. I have talked to friends and a couple of adults, and they told me to keep telling my parents. I don't know where to turn or what to do.Edit: Thanks for the support, guys. I wrote this at 6 in the morning, so I missed a few minor details. For instance, depression runs in my family. Both my grandmother and older brother have been diagnosed with severe cases. Why my parents don't believe/listen to me, hell if I know. Also, I was going to mention that I have given up on religion (live in the Bible Belt; parents are strict Christians), and for a while I thought that was the source of my emptiness, but it's not. Also, I saw a [movie](_URL_ that was about a kid who turned himself in for depression/suicidal thoughts. After watching the movie with my brother, I told him that it was exactly how I felt. (Great movie, by the way.) It seems, though, that some people are just saying to think positively.. It's really, really difficult for me, and I don't know why. I've tried in the past, though. I had a friend who wanted to help and did her own research, and tried to give me advice. One was to write down three good things that happened today, and the other was to try to revert bad thoughts into good by coming up with silly mental images related to the negative thought. The silly mental image was supposed to be silly enough to make me laugh on the inside and cause a small bit of dopamine to be released, causing the bad thought to be silly and meaningless, while the good thought remained to be the more important one. These two things worked effectively, but only for just a couple of days, and then it wore off.

248,"Hi guys,i just want to talk about my life and situation atm. The last couple of years were really wierd for me. Ive had my ups and my downs, like everybody does, but i feel like something isnt going quite right and its pretty obvious. Lets start with my age. What really bothers me is that i forgot how old i am exactly. Either i turn 20 or 21 in the next month and to be honest - i dont even care to look up how old i am. This might not sound to bad, but its more the carelessness that bugs me.. Another thing is that i read all the time or play video games when i dont have to learn for university. I dont go out because i have no friends, so i have learned to spend my time alone with books and videogames. It bothered and worried me in the beginning but not anymore.. I might even be addicted to both. Because im not going out anyway and nobody gets to see me, i dont shower at all. it doesnt make me feel better and i dont even see a point in it, because theres nobody around me anyway. My appartment is pretty much a mess, but ive managed to controll it so its not all that horrible. One problem is the kitchen tho. Everything in my fridge is rotten, it smells like i have a dead body in it.. Even tho i thought i need to clean it because its obviously not healthy (i dont even put food in my fridge tho), i am never doing it and to be frank it doesnt even seem to matter to me.Another thing that concerns me is my sexuality. While im having some fetish, i wouldnt say im to far away from the norm. I never had a girlfriend even tho i would consider myself good looking (and in school atleast i was good smelling too :p), but i never really cared about it. Having a girlfriend or a family just seems wrong to me. Another thing is that i am born with phimosis and i never even seen a doctor because of it. It just feels senseless to me to ""fix"" the situation, because i cant see myself with a woman anyway.Other than that.. sometimes im sad because i grew up without a father and when i actually think about him it makes me sick and i wish for him to ""disappear"". He contributes to the hate and sadness i have inside. (i dont want to talk about him further)I just feel empty. I want someone who understands me, who laughs with me. What i want is to find happiness and prove myself that i am not as worthless as i might be in reality.I dont really have something im very good at. Im mediocre at writing and playing games. Well, i guess i know what i learned during my studies, but im far from the best in my course(s). I know someone who was a friend of mine before i went away to study, he has passion for sports, wants to keep in shape and is now going to the police.Thats what i want... a goal to persue, but i cant find something i show passion for. Its almost like im just mindlessly consuming food and drinks, reading about wonderful stories, lifes and possiblities, while in real life just waiting to die. Every night, i listen to the sound of my heart beating and trying to make sense of my existence, even tho its more than foolish. Theres no reason, but i thought i might as well try to spend my time on earth happy, or atleast building up or destroying something. If i die this second nowbody but my mother would be bothered or really be sad about it.. Hell i dont even think my father would be at my funeral. Thats atleast what my mother told me.I just feel empty and i want so much to fill it. All i know is i need to find something i can dedicate my life to before my mother dies. I cannot die, before she does, it would make her sad and break her heart. And i just cant and dont want me to picture her sad, because i care about her more than all other people in my life combined. If she would be gone there wouldnt really be anything else i could hold on to. Of course i thought of just letting go, but i came to the conclusion that is not what i want.I want people to recognise me, curse me, love me,fear me and know my name. I want to help the world to change and leave my imprint before i go. I just dont know how yet.  So i dont see myself dying soon even tho it would make things a lot easier. I dont know what to do.. (besides that i have to clean my goddamn fridge): wait until i just find something im passionate for?Pray for the best? (even tho i dont believe in any god)Im not sure what i want to hear from you guys, i guess i just wanted to write it down and tbh it helped. It could be worse :pPS: Sorry for my bad english.

Suffice it to say, when you know what it feels like to have your dreams crushed like a ball of glass hitting a cement wall at terminal velocity, the cold feel of a gun barrel feels like the most sure thing you've ever felt.My main issue with asking for help is this : whenever I tell people about these feelings, they spout off why I SHOULD keep living, such as how killing myself would hurt others I love. What I'm really asking, though, is what is there WORTH living for? No one gives me a good answer on that because it seems you're all just as lost as I am about it. Please, feel free to prove me wrong, but I doubt the veracity of any claims of worth as being just another guilt trip or a vague ""you have so much still to live for"" excuse.",0,14,171,quote specifically part playing head bother melodramatic pity story suffice feels dreams crushed ball glass hitting cement wall terminal velocity cold feel gun barrel feels thing felt main issue people feelings spout living killing hurt love worth living good answer lost feel free prove wrong doubt veracity claims worth guilt trip vague live excuse,8.0,14.0,4,4,2,6,3,8,4,4

Knowing that makes it more depressing to try.""Just try something new. Escape from &lt;problem\&gt;.""My problem is not external. It lives within. New things are similar to what I have tried.

I haven't died because of my attempts failing.""Just change you outlook and cheer up.""Another of the worst things to say. If it was that easy, there wouldn't be any suicides.""There are other people in worse conditions.""Guilt trip? Really?

253,"I've never really asked for help online. I usually go to my close friends for advice. Anyways, my names _PERSON_ and I'm starting to get negative thoughts again. With everything that's gone into my life and all the obstacles I can't see myself overcoming, i feel like giving up. There's been 3 suicides the past week at my city and it's literally eating at me. The fact that someone 18 years into their life is just gone. _PERSON_, like a forgotten memory. _PERSON_ have been organized by friends and family and my school today mentioned a passing of a student who committed suicide yesterday because of another person doing it. It feels as if this can be a chain reaction and I feel like it's about time that I hop on board. I've been depressing for a while. Every since I was a kid I always dreamt of becoming older like I am now. ""Oh man, when i become 18 my grandparents won't hit me anymore."" Well that time has come and I still get yelled at. I still get told I'm a failure. My friends have to give me rides to their houses when I want to see them because my mom believes she's sick which is utter bullshit. I know she has some illnesses because I have some too, but she uses them as an excuse. You know when you have to do chores or really anything that you dont want to, and how you start to feel tired or weak? It's like that for her but instead its with every little thing she does. She's gone to professionals and almost all of them have referred her to a counselor of some sort. She was absent during my childhood which led to my grandparents who are absolute scum, to take care of me. They beat my mom and her sisters and the tradition was passed down to me. I wasn't beat as in like punched or anything. I was mostly slapped but they would ground me and make me stay in my room for long periods of time. No getting water, no bathroom, nothing. I would have to pee in empty water bottles. Not only did that happen, but i had a bed wetting problem up to around 4th grade. The doctors said I had an underdeveloped bladder and that it'll take me a bit to be able to hold it in as I sleep. My grandparents didn't understand that. They still believed it was my fault and they would scream at me and put me down to the point where i would pack up my things and walk out of the door. Keep in mind I was around 8 or 9 so after a couple steps I would run back into the house, afraid of being alone.Shortly after that I moved and it was actually pretty nice. I made friends easily and formed some truly great freindships. After a while I moved again... and again...and again... and now i'm moving again. Right before i go off to college too. Luckily because of my mom not having a job because ""she's too sick"" i'm allowed to get bussed by my school since my mom pays no rent which technically considers me to be homeless. When highschool hit I immediately performed poor and now as a senior i have a 2.2 gpa. It's awful and I'm ashamed, but i lack the drive to give it my all. It's not even from the stupid things going on around me, i'm also extremely lazy. From a sociological standpoint it's because my grandparents and mom are all unemployed so i think it rubbed off on me and became second nature. They only leave the house for groceries really. My mom's had shitty boyfriends that have lived with us and ruined my life. Hogging my videogames (which are my passion and escape) to threatening me, beating my mom, cheating on her, and various other things. My mom has an awful choice in men and now she's dating yet again so thats of course going to end badly._PERSON_, my father left when I was 4 which led to me being an emotional wreck that had a shell that breaks like glass. Little comments towards me drastically affect how i feel. I dont normally retaliate because i hate being mean to people, but it leaves me upset when i'm on my lonesome and ruins the bonds i've gained with my pals. Me being black leads to stupid jokes always being said. I live in an overwhelmingly white community so i often hear racist jokes. I know they have no ill intent but it still crushes my insides and makes me feel like a sack of shit. I tell them constantly (after letting it happen for several years) to stop. Or just not giving them a response. Yet they still do it and i absolutely hate it. One day i'm going to snap and i dont want it to get to that point.Apart from that i have an alright set of friends. Theyre who i always hangout with even though i have a good amount of people to talk to, basically none containing women. I mean yeah that's okay, but none of my friends are sensitive or know what i'm going through. I've talked to the ""popular"" girls and such asking for help a couple weeks after we've talked and theyll give okay advice and then basically stop talking to me. They'll say like hi in the halls MAYBE, unless they're with friends. It sucks. I don't think i'm unattracive or anything and i dont have a bad image so i dont know if its because i'm at the middle in terms of popularity and since i'm not a jock they dont want to associative with me.So yeah, i just want some help. People to help pick me up. I need something refreshing apart from the things that my friends have been recylcing for years. The funny thing is i've given them and plenty others advice in life. Whether that be relationship or personal. Yet i cant follow the things i direct them to. I've been in such a good place for the past to years but with the stress of not getting into a college even though i've been accepted, the fear of not finding someone, the fear of having to move again and not see my friends anymore because of distance when school ends, and everything else, i feel like my shell has cracked and everything is flowing back in.

255,"Im a monster. I dont get it. Im so empathetical, so sensitive, so privy to others pain and joy. Yet still I have lurid, disgusting thoughts. And yet I revel in them. In uncontrolable fetishes, in murder fantasy. I broke into a friends moms house and stole her shoes and jewelry. Today I wanted to snatch someones purse for money, so I could get drugs to take me away from this world. I will probably still do it. And some how I dont feel bad doing any of it. Ive stolen from friends and family. Im a kleptomaniac and I enjoy it. Why does anyone give a shit about me? If they even really do. Why? Im a petty con man and thief. I wasnt raised in poverty. My family has wealth, yet I've the gall to squander my oppurtunities and shit on my future? I dont deserve to even be miserable and yet I am. Every hour just compounding pain. Ive been in pysch wards twice now. The first one during a horribly abusive ""friendship"". I stayed 4 days. 4 days of torture. No privacy, constant screaming from the other in patients. They put me on Risperdal, I think that shit permanently fucked my brain. Ruined my fucking mine. For what, for a company to make a buck? Is that all I am, a fucking geaunie pig? A fucking failed experiment? Well I certainly failed. Ive dropped out of college 4 fucking times. I have so many failed classes. The only jobs Ive ever had was shitty fast food or cleaning. I used to work at _PERSON_. When I had weed things could be okay. When I didnt every moment spent alone led to mental breakdown. I would regularly cry during delivery runs, or in the freezer when I worked inside. I quite without notice, twice. Ive quit all my jobs without notice. What did it matter anyways? They were shit jobs for minimum wage.I fucking hate being alive. I cant be happy anymore. The only time Im ever happy is if I can get high with weed. Look down me for it. Call me a drug addict, call me a junkie this world will. But I dont know a single fucking soul that doesnt down something to make it through the day. If I could just live in the woods and grow pot and food and smoke all day I fucking would. But I cant, because if I did then some fuckers would come up, burn it to the ground then point guns at me and shove me into a cage until I rotted and died. And society would be okay with it, many would even applaud it. A joke. ""Do what whatever makes you happy!"" Is a fucking joke. Anyone who says it is a goddamn stand up comedian. Okay. Sure. Fine. Want to know what would make me happy? Well I already told you. Id live in nature in the forest and Id grow a field of pot and harvest it. But I cant, so I cant be happy. Now go ahead and tell me Im wrong. Tell me that wouldnt make me happy and Im just ever so obviously confused. No no, youre right and Im wrong, because you said so. If you wanna be happy just get on your knees and beg the demon in the sky to grant you entrance to hia kingdom. Then slave away at a shit job you dont like to earn money for people you dont like to provide service you hate to customers you hate. Do it shit eater, go get your shit eating job and put on your shit eating grin so you can make it another day to be promoted to shit eater leader.I live in a world where our elected leaders control a large group of violent people that will kill anyone on command.I live in a world where psychotropic pills are shoved down the throats of the mentally ill and weak to sedate them and generate profit with little to no understanding of how they work.I live in a world where children are slain and raped and beaten by their own parents.A world where in my home country oppposers to the gangs and police and politicians, who are one in the same are killed.People believe in demons and gods based on fairy tales in a book. But okay sure. Im the monster, obviously. I really am because Ive never done _PERSON_ shit about it but complain. Never done _PERSON_ shit to help anyone else because Im a hipocritical stuck up close minded shit eating faggot fat worthless unfriendly slobbish beast of the wild that calls itself human.And now the good shit. This world is trash and so am _PERSON_ on a killing spree would be fun, in theory. But no, fuck that. Fuck that mass murder spree bullshit. Thatshit makes the world into the place driving me to this in the first place. So _PERSON_ probably go on a stealing spree. Buy a shit load of weed, smoke myself silly and then in a moment where I feel good _PERSON_ shoot myself. Or maybe down pills and booze. Whichever is more appealing. Im not long for this world. But dont miss me, Im not worth missing. Dont mourne me, my life was garbage anyways. If you do, then go take something you dont like and then throw it in the bin. Then cry for days over it. Become depressed over it, maybe even suicidal yourself. Then hold a funeral service. But you wouldnt because thats stupid. Because putting that much emotional invesment over a piece of trash in the bin is fucking retarded. So what makes me any different? If I werent so goddamn egotistical and self centered I probably wouldve already died already. I have to die some day anyways. Might as well deprive nature the sick pleasure of picking my demise for me and instead taking it for myself.Im sorry to my brother. Although you can be angry crude and mean, you genuinely cared. You really fucking did. You are honestly one in a billion, a good person. Im sorry I dont love you more to stop myself from causing you pain. But I love you.Im sorry to my past self. It didnt get better, I lied to you. It only got worse and I lied to your face, torturing you for the amusment of others.Im sorry to anyone this hurts. But theres nothing I can do about it. I will die anyways. Im not going through pain to appease others anymore, I just cant handle it, Im just not strong enough. Im just going to have one last toke and then its goodbye.

I don't want that.I haven't told anyone, but there's two letters on the side of my bookshelf facing away from the door. I live with three wonderful roommates; they would never spot it unless they would go into my room - which they never do. One says ""So I Just Died (Bummer) Now What?"" which are instructions on what to do with my stuff. Not will kind of decision making, more stuff that's in their power. Who they might want to call and why, how to handle my funeral should my parents bury me as a boy (let them grieve and do your own potluck or thing should you want), etc. The second letter has more information.I've had suicide ideation for a very long time. It ebbs and flows. First started when I was 5, not really understanding it, maybe not really meaning it. I told my parents, who then suspended me over the deep end of a stair case asking me if I wanted to die. They were well-meaning but bad parents. I did one half-hearted attempt as a teen with tylenols - the kind of thing I knew deep down wouldn't work but somehow wish it would get me away from this. It's been with me since. Sometimes it's less. Right now it's more.And I'm struggling. I know how I'll do it (involves butane) and roughly where (not at home - don't want to traumatize roommates or friends.) The truth is I really don't see me being alive in 3 years. And it's not for any immediate crisis. I haven't lost a lover or a friend, the greatest difficulties around transitioning are behind me. I just feel empty. And I'm continuing on, I'm not sure why but I am, maybe because I feel I owe it to younger me, but I don't know how much longer I can take this.I guess I should probably get on anti-depressants, but I'm really uneasy approaching the person who may or may not be my doctor (she's not accepting patients but helping me transition after transphobia meant I couldn't continue with my last doctor.) She's made comments that she'd stop prescribing me hormone replacement therapy if warning signs came up; I'm afraid this could be construed as some.I don't know. I just don't want to be here. Ideal scenario is checking myself in a hospital, but they'd never take me because I'm too well, and I don't want to take the place of people who need it.

259,"[EDIT] Goodbye.I'm not intending this to sound like a rant, so I apologize if it comes off that way. I'm just a long winded person.I was born on tour with the Grateful Dead at the Forum in L.A., needless to say my parents were hippies. They moved up to Canada before I was a year old, but my Dad constantly beat my Mom so they divorced when I was 4. The only time I saw him after that was at my cousins funeral when I was 17. I held my tongue out of respect for my cousin who passed away.When I was 12 my Mom, sister, and I moved down to San Diego, California. I went from a very happy community, where I had good friends, to a place where I knew nothing about. Every day was hell as I would constantly get beat on (my middle school has a lot of ""cholo"" kids, as did my high schools). So I started taking self defense to protect my self at school. Karate became my life, as I was spending almost every day at the _PERSON_, eventually becoming the Sempai (Highest _PERSON_) of the class.After I finished Middle school, I was on the bottom of the totem pole, but that quickly changed as my classmates learned I could now fight back.Then, one day as I was walking home I dropped by my old middle school to say hi to my friends that were in the grade below me. Where one of the bullies that had once picked on me was still attending, as he had been held back a year. He, unaware to my new ability to fight, attacked me barehanded. While he managed to break my glasses, he only succeeded in enraging me. I lost my temper and started beating him as hard as I could. In the chaos, he pulled out a knife, which I had been taught to defend myself against. I reversed the blade on him, planting it into his own stomach. This secured my arrest, and expulsion from the San Diego school district.I was promptly sent to _PERSON_, which is where I spent 6 months of not knowing what became of the boy I fought and stabbed. Eventually not caring. The only time I cried is when I found out my dog, Cisco, had been put to sleep while I was locked up. It was really after this that I started to notice an absence of emotions.After spending Christmas, and my 15th birthday in Juvy, I was released into House Arrest for another 6 months. The only communication I was allowed was online, which was how I stayed in contact with my friends in Canada, as I didn't have good enough friends to talk to me after that incident in San Diego. However, I was allowed 1 on 1 time at the _PERSON_ with my Sensei. I was spending around 12 hours a day training.By the time I was off house arrest, I had caught up to my schooling through JCCS. Being expelled from my high school left me with little option of where to attend. So I entered the Charter School program. Which allowed me to continue spending most of my time training, as I was finishing semesters in a matter of days, and only turning in the work once every 2 weeks. This lasted for around a year.When I was 16 I wanted to start attending a normal school again and try to still manage some sort of a normal adolescence. I had gotten back into my High School that I was originally attending. Unfortunately, 2 months after the school year began, my Mom had a disagreement with the principal, which lead to me immediate expulsion. Then after a long bout of trial and error with different schools in the area, all of which I was expelled for fighting (in self defense). I was allowed into La Jolla High School. Which is a VERY respected high school. On the only condition that if I was not allowed to fight. In the situation of a fight, I was to just get hit and leave it at that. And that was fine by me, for the chance to graduate normally. Actually walk and get my high school diploma.Since La Jolla High was operating on a classic schedule, and my old school was on a 4 block schedule, I was staying after school for an ""8th period"" where I was in the office answering phones for an extracurricular. At 3:30pm I got out, went to a vending machine, just for a snack as I was VERY hungry. Not even 2 minutes after I sat down for my gummi worms, yet another bully came up to me for the sole purpose of torment. He took my food, and when I asked for it back, he punched me in the stomach. It barely hurt, so I knew taking a beating was entirely possible. I made it through the ordeal with my favorite Rufio shirt torn into an unwearable state. a bloody lip, and some bruises on my abdomen. Nothing bad at all. And that didn't even slow them down what-so-ever in my expulsion. Regardless of the ""don't throw a punch"" promise that I held up to. They still kicked me out.In the very same week, my Sensei, whom I thought to be dying (shes 70+) from the manner in which she was teaching me, told me she was moving to a different state. She told me this while I was a low brown belt, and for the next year I trained every day, so when she moved to train with the head of my style (Hanshi, aka Teacher of Teachers) I followed her and skipped my middle brown belt, and high brown belt, to achieve _PERSON_, or First Black Belt. I am very proud of this, but there isn't much a black belt from a traditional style can do with out their Sensei. So with no where to go from there, I joined the Military.I origionally wanted to become an EOD, but due to a training accident in bootcamp, that quickly became more fantasy. What I thought was a sprain, turned out to be a rare, untreated form of _PERSON_. Which ruined blood flow to my talus navicular causing it to collapse. I thought it was just a sprain so I kept it to myself, not wanting to stay in boot camp any longer than I had to. So I switched rates to Fire Control (The guys that shoot the cannons on a ship).This rate turned out to have a 2 year contract extension, which I signed in a stack of papers I was told to sign.And that 2 years was spent at Great Lakes, _PERSON_. _PERSON_. This base had one of the highest suicide rates out of any base in the military. I believe there were 3-6 in the 2 years I spent there, accounting for roughly 10% of all suicides in the navy per year. Needless to say, I was unhappy.I was constantly in trouble for the sole reason of my depression. To the point where I would sleep in a comatose state, and they would be unable to wake me with the assistance of a Bullhorn.When the truth of my injury came to light, the base doctors put it down as a ""prior injury"" due to the wear on the bones from my martial arts training. When taken I was taken to an orthopedic surgeon he said my foot would be able to be fixed with surgery, and my Tricare would cover it. When it came time for my insurace company to say they would foot the bill, they stepped up to the plate and said they would pay in full. All I needed was approval for the convalescent leave. Which the base denied on the ground that they were removing me from service. Which I had heard no news of until it came time to fix my foot. They kicked me out with half months pay x4 which had to come out of my TSP.And now I've been out for a year. In which I helped my family open a medicinal marijuana dispensary, that I may or may not work at. I say that because every day I live in fear of getting fired. Lately it's been so bad that I may not even be able to make rent this month. As every day I show up for work, I get yelled at for something irrelevent to work. The reason I'm currently fired is because I lost a contact lens. The time before that was because I didn't eat breakfast.I'm running out of ability to tolerate the world. If anyone can bring the slightest ammount of happiness to me, it would be much appreciated. But as it stands, I'm ready to kill myself.",1,8,1478,edit goodbye intending sound rant apologize long winded person born tour grateful dead forum needless parents hippies moved canada year dad constantly beat mom divorced time cousins funeral held tongue respect cousin passed mom sister moved san diego california happy community good friends place knew day hell constantly beat middle school lot cholo kids high schools started taking defense protect school karate life spending day person eventually sempai highest person class finished middle school bottom totem pole quickly changed classmates learned fight back day walking home dropped middle school friends grade bullies picked attending held back year unaware ability fight attacked barehanded managed break glasses succeeded enraging lost temper started beating hard chaos pulled knife taught defend reversed blade planting stomach secured arrest expulsion san diego school district promptly person spent months knowing boy fought stabbed eventually caring time cried found dog cisco put sleep locked started notice absence emotions spending christmas birthday juvy released house arrest months communication allowed online stayed contact friends canada good friends talk incident san diego allowed time person sensei spending hours day training time house arrest caught schooling jccs expelled high school left option attend entered charter school program allowed continue spending time training finishing semesters matter days turning work weeks lasted year wanted start attending normal school manage sort normal adolescence back high school originally attending months school year began mom disagreement principal lead expulsion long bout trial error schools area expelled fighting defense allowed la jolla high school respected high school condition allowed fight situation fight hit leave fine chance graduate walk high school diploma la jolla high operating classic schedule school block schedule staying school period office answering phones extracurricular pm vending machine snack hungry minutes sat gummi worms bully sole purpose torment food asked back punched stomach barely hurt knew taking beating made ordeal favorite rufio shirt torn unwearable state bloody lip bruises abdomen bad slow expulsion don throw punch promise held kicked week sensei thought dying manner teaching told moving state told low brown belt year trained day moved train head style hanshi aka teacher teachers skipped middle brown belt high brown belt achieve person black belt proud black belt traditional style sensei joined military origionally wanted eod due training accident bootcamp quickly fantasy thought sprain turned rare untreated form person ruined blood flow talus navicular causing collapse thought sprain wanting stay boot camp longer switched rates fire control guys shoot cannons ship rate turned year contract extension signed stack papers told sign years spent great lakes person person base highest suicide rates base military years spent accounting roughly suicides navy year needless unhappy constantly trouble sole reason depression point sleep comatose state unable wake assistance bullhorn truth injury light base doctors put prior injury due wear bones martial arts training orthopedic surgeon foot fixed surgery tricare cover time insurace company foot bill stepped plate pay full needed approval convalescent leave base denied ground removing service heard news time fix foot kicked half months pay tsp year helped family open medicinal marijuana dispensary work day live fear fired bad make rent month day show work yelled irrelevent work reason fired lost contact lens time eat breakfast running ability tolerate world bring slightest ammount happiness appreciated stands ready kill,47.0,69.0,40,30,14,44,16,43,13,48

But something is. I've been obsessed with crazy thoughts for a while. A lot of anxiety. Very strange thoughts. They don't make sense at all and I'm probably the only person in the world who has these specific thoughts. The thoughts itself make me anxious. For thinking about them. For simply having them. And for being unable to avoid them. I also feel like I think about everything. Every detail. I remember everything. _PERSON_ focused on every single thing I do. How it feels. When I use my laptop, I think about all the components it's made of and I think of scary thoughts like ""if the laptop breaks now, I'd have to buy a new one and I barely have enough money"".I'm also obsessed with hygiene. To an extreme. People eating in my house annoys me greatly. When they leave crumbs or don't wash their hands after eating something like pizza, I go insane. I also don't like people going in my room and I feel like I go mad when people use my laptop or something else I generally use. I can't explain why...My hands also tend to get a tiny bit sweaty when I'm using the laptop and this also greatly causes me anxiety. I don't wash my hands for germs, but because I feel like they're always sweaty. And I'm hesitant to touch anything when they're like that. My face also gets really oily so I have to wash it several times a day. When I touch my face and I see my finger is oily from face, I get great anxiety and have to wash face asap :(The worst thought however is the most crazy one. I don't remember exactly how it started but I imagine everything has a ""stutter"". Yeah, that sounds crazy doesn't it? Moving my eyes around, I imagine there's some micro stuttering or something like that. As if I ""feel"" something while looking... some kind of detail. Same with movement or touching. I can think there is a stutter while walking. Touching an object. Typing. My heart beating. Even music. Anything basically. This causes me great anxiety. It isn't logical at all... but I keep ""looking"" for it. Like the thought won't go away. It's like I summon the thought myself when it's gone because I have to feel it again... just to be sure. It's like fighting a losing battle. The fact it can happen anywhere and ith anything is probably the biggest reason I'm afraid.I really don't know what to do.

278,"Hey /r/SuicideWatch.I found this sub-reddit several days ago and I think this might be the right place to reach out for help.So I'm 16 now. My life wasn't really all that bad before. It kinda was, but comparing it to what it is now... back then it wasn't really that bad. I was a straight A student. I almost didn't get a grade different than an A. My mom was a horrible mother back then. She'd always yell at me for the littlest of things and beat me with various things. I think that's when I got a bit fucked up in the head. But other than that, I wasn't thinking about everything I'm thinking about now... I started getting bad grades at school because I just don't want to study all this bullshit anymore. For me if you want to be like an architect or an engineer, hey that's fine. But I don't wanna study all that stupid stuff I'm never going to need or like history and geography just because it's good to know them out of common culture. I hate school. My parents always yell at me because of school. Times like now, winter break are great because I'm not at school and they don't get mad about my grades. But maybe it's not just that I don't like school but I'm also not motivated to do anything. I used to go to the gym before, now I'm just  kinda fluffy, I got a belly. I'm going trough a fucking mid-life crysis. I'm worried about not getting a job, and how life doesn't seem to make sense... God I don't even know. So many toughts rush trough my head every second I don't even know what to do. I started drinking, smoking. I don't like this shit, I don't think I'm cool, but I don't want to live. I don't have the balls to kill myself. I've thought about it. I've decided if I'm gonna do it I'm gonna drown. My mom kicked me out of the house at one Christmas and I was really close to doing it. All I want is to find a girlfriend. I've never kissed a girl, never had a girlfriend, I'm a fucking loser. If I had someone, whom I knew loved me, I think I would want to live. And be a better person for her. But that's never going to fucking happen and it's killing me. I just want to die. The other day I went out with my friend and his gf, and he left early, getting real pissed because he thought I was hitting on his girl.

279,"This might turn out long...I'm 16 and 1/2 years old. My name, country and everything else is irrelevant. Let me start from my childhood. My mom beat me up and my dad was a sailor so he would be gone for 6 months at a time. And when he was back, my parents would constantly shout at each other, then my father would go out and get drunk and end up sleeping at my grandma's for a few days.Sure, my childhood sucked, but it's nothing compared to my miserable existence now.I used to have friends. I had good grades... I was somewhat normal. But as life progressed I found out I didn't really have friends. They would get together without me, not invite me to their birthdays. I just gave up on the idea of having friends, thinking they weren't such an important part of life.But the summer 2 years ago, being all alone I spent the entire summer inside, just watching movies all day, going out once a day to get something to eat and that's all I'd do. I started feeling lonely. God, I felt lonely... That's when I got in a state of depression. I started hating myself, the way I look, the person I had grow up to become. I realised I'm stupid, ugly, fat. I didn't care about any of that before, I used to think I'm normal, that I'd live a normal life, be a part of the ""System"". Get good grades, get a good job, have a family and finally die. The following year my grades got bad. I started hating school. The teachers, my classmates. I found the material we were learning to be boring and pointless, so I had absolutely no desire to learn it since I thought the educational system was feeding me useless information with a spoon.The next year it got even worse. _PERSON_ even worse. Life even worse. Much lonelier, scared... I wanted to kill myself. I remember the 1st time. I just sat on a bench for 2 hours and thought about how much I want to die. I went to my (GP?) I don't really know what it's called in english, but basically I asked for anti-depresants. She sent me to a psychiatrist in the local madhouse. I spoke to her about the way I felt and since I was underage she said I'd have to call my parents. And I did. That's when they found out. The way they explained it was ""To this point they didn't know about my condition. They just thought I'm kind of a distant person, not showing much emotion. A part of being a teenager"". But it wasn't like that. What bothered me more is that they found out. I didn't want that to happen because I knew that they'd be overly loving and carring for some time and then they'd go back to the way they were before as if nothing had happened. Well that's exactly how things went.Anyways I changed 2 doctors, both of them tried to help me, but they couldn't... All they did was perscribe a dozen pills, which didn't do anything but tranquilize me like a horse, not making me feel better, but saditated enough so I don't do anything... kill myself. Which I thought about a lot. Came to the conclusion the best way would be to drown.I had found this subreddit for some time. At New Year's Eve 2013 I read a lot of people's life storries, how miserable their lives where, their expectations that things would get better, but they never did. And since I was alone, my parents gone somewhere I got out in the rain, sat on a bench and stayed there for 2 hours just thinking about my life. That changed me. It made me realise a lot of things. All I ever wanted was to be loved. You'd think most guys my age just want to fuck some girl, no emotions no nothing. But I'm not like that. Sure, I want to have sex, but what's even stronger in me is the desire to just hug a girl. Hold her thight as time slows down and stops. Being in each other's arms for what seems like an ethernity. Softly kiss. That's all I want. But as old as I am I've never kissed a girl, had a gf, nothing. I don't wanna become like that guy who killed the people in California. Complaining how he never got laid and what not. I don't want to become psychotic like him. But my life is just falling apart, I have no ambition, perspective. Living day by day, not thinking about the future, because I stoped caring. As if I'm already dead and life doesn't matter. I confessed my love to a girl, because I knew at one point she liked me, but I had so many things on my plate I didn't do anything about that. I just let her go. And when I told her I love her she didn't know what to say. And eventually just cut me off, saying her feelings for me were just temporaty and that now I mean nothing to her. She was the best thing that could've happened in my life and I missed it. At this point, failing school, barely getting out of bed every morning, feeling like crap all the time all I want to do is die. And I'll do it. I just needed to tell someone my story. Even if only one person reads this, I need to know at some point in time another living being knew who I was and my story, so that I don't leave this world as if I had never been in it.I don't think anyone can help me at this point... I really don't. _PERSON_ isn't my 1st language, most of it I haven't learned in school, but by watching cartoon network as a child.

297,"Hey, guys and gals. It's me again.I'm sure that you're all familiar with my story, or at least my type. I have this tendency to get depressed around the winter months (though my blue feelings seem to know no seasonal boundaries), and for the most part, I've held it off this year.Recently, though, I've noticed some terrible changes in my character. I feel lethargic all the time, and it makes me feel as though my life is pointless. I'm in this weird paradox where I want to be alive, but I don't want to suffer through the boring spots. I've also been trying to shed this whole thing where I put being in a relationship on a pedestal. It worked for a long time, but at least once every few days it comes back to haunt me.All of these things have made me incredibly nasty towards at least one of my friends, and I find that coming out and talking to my friends is as effective as talking to a brick wall. I have a feeling that it's because I've got this one track mind, and it's so difficult for me to break it.I've read a lot of different stories from this particular sub-Reddit where people are trying to get over relationships, and part of the responses is ""it just takes some time."" I think that I'm just realizing how long it really will take for me. I wasn't just in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend, I had a crush on her for three years, and I still think about her (though it's getting to be less frequent as days go on).I can't find a job, but at the same time I acknowledge that I certainly haven't put forth the necessary effort. I know that there are people who turn in applications every day, and I only fill out a handful of applications periodically only to be disappointed when no one calls. My dad convinced me that I had a slam-dunk over at a gas station, because the manager offered *him* a job; but when he went to check, the manager told him that they weren't hiring because they're short on hours as it is.

I go in tomorrow to figure out when I start working and all that.Also, earlier in the week, I started flirting with a girl that I've known for a few months who is recently single. She seemed pretty receptive, but tonight, she ended up shooting me down because that's just how the world works. It probably didn't help that in the time we've known each other, I did bring up my exes a lot.

I feel like I can't go anywhere with my problems anymore because I'll always be looked at like a whiny little bitch or something.I work a pretty shitty job, dealing with swarms of assholes on a daily basis. That is to say, I'm a gas station attendant, and people treat me like scum. At first, I grinned and bore it, but now I dread going into work. I'm burnt out on it. I used to be polite and talkative, but in the last week especially, I feel like that part of me isn't around anymore.It seems as though /r/relationship_advice was right about the girl I was crushing on. She was only leading me on. She's probably spending the night at her boyfriend's right now. She told me last night that she didn't want to hurt my feelings, but I don't believe that in the slightest.I've slowly turned into a misogynist, which I never wanted. Almost every woman I meet and befriend, I feel as if I can't trust. And yet, the majority of my friends are women. I have some guy friends, but a lot of them are rather annoying and definitely overstay their welcome.I can feel myself becoming more and more antisocial as the days go on, to the point where my ex-girlfriend told me that she feels as if she never even happened to me.To give you a summary of that: I ""dated"" a girl I know from Canada for about four or five months. She helped to pull me up from my dark little hole, but then we stopped talking for a while, and finally broke up.She told me tonight that I'm an asshole because I apparently make it out so that my feelings are the only ones that matter, and maybe I am that way, but I feel so victimized all the time. I know that we all have to climb our own mountains, and I just can't help but vent about how my voyage *must* be harder than everyone else's because *I'm* experiencing it, even though I know that others have it harder and I have little right to complain.I feel as though I'm overstaying my welcome, too, and since I've pretty much all ready decided to eliminate myself from the gene pool because I'm convinced that I'll never find someone who lives up to what I want, I've been considering taking myself out of the game entirely. I've been thinking of a whole variety of different methods, while toying with the idea of just seeking help from a professional (even though past attempts with professionals have been fruitless).

She has little money and wants to kill herself.My friend has been talking to her for hours most nights to try and keep her from doing anything bad. He cannot continue to do this as it is effecting his life with his family.Are there any support networks in Japan for people like this? young, suicidal, no friends, no money, possibly no where to live.

336,"Everyone here has it so much worse than me. I feel like a spoiled brat. I am a drug addict, but high functioning. Drive brand new BMW (paid in cash), parents still support me, work at a hedge fund, but feel the draw back to the college drug dealing says. After a couple years of hiatus and going legit, I want to move beyond weed and start on the higher margin stuff: heroin, special K, prescription benzodiazepines and pain killers. The online market and ease of anonymity make it an attractive venture to enter into and frankly life as a criminal was much more exciting and lucrative (if you can, buy all of your cars from a dealer using a suitcase of money.) I heard about rich kids getting high at boarding school and drug use at the _PERSON_. Having supplied such clientele (coming from such a background), I've seen many lives ruined as I happily at the time took their money. Which was probably embezzled from their parents, proceeds from a stolen XBOX craigslist sale, loan from a trustafarian brethren.College stopped. I got a serious girlfriend. We feel in love, deeply. I had no desire to go back to my old ways and was clean of all narcotics for over 2 years. Then, she dumped me. 3 months later I'm _PERSON_ heroin and at a real low point. I got some help, moved, did rehab, got out, got a good job, won the respect of my Father again, and continue to get on my feet. Until I relapsed recently and got back into the habit.I don't know if it's the winter weather, but every day the suicidal feelings become more paramount. I want to do it, but I don't want to hurt those around me who care. I want them to know it has everything to do with me and nothing about them. I want to die of an ""accidental"" drug overdose and not a suicide attempt. People around me can live with that sort of thing and attribute it to the problem I've been struggling with for years.It's also hard to ignore the allure of going back to a criminal lifestyle. Selling lbs per week of weed in college netted me some cool cash and an equally cool and laid back lifestyle. Since then I've acquired knowledge that could make my criminal enterprise much more sophisticated. I view this as another means to my own self-destruction--die, get into jail, die in jail, or die avoiding getting into jail. It is really odd for me to type all of this and realize that some of my best friends growing up were children of the most influential investors and NYC movers and shakers. I went to private school, got a great education, did OK in college, bullshitted my way into a comfy management job at 26, and now find myself thinking of ways I can shoot up in my office at work. Anyone else in the same situation? I've been to plenty of NA meetings and while they say they view all participants as equals, my background is not at all like those who attend the program. I couldn't find a sponsor to empathize with, only someone who could repeat the tenements of the NA program, which in analysis is one of the largest cults on the planet.I talk to close friends about this, but they all come from the same socioeconomic rich white dudes background and seem to avoid the ""disease"" (a term I use reluctantly) of addiction. Just got a _PERSON_ refill less than 2 hours ago and already downed 10MG. Excess isn't for sucidal purposes. I'd need to consume several hundred MGs of _PERSON_ to even reach LD50 levels.

I don't come from money or a background that values education or ambition. I realized, way too late into my life, that I missed out on a proper childhood. I spent my summers and free time at home watching TV and playing video games rather than going to camps or discovering an intellectual interest or participating in sports programs or engaging in any social activity. I've been diagnosed with a mild form of autism, and have also been diagnosed with intense general anxiety. Even if I try to connect with others, I can't. I'm just too different.

355,"I don't know where to start, with this.I guess I'll explain a little about myself. Even revealing my name so that people can at least see me as a person rather than just an account on reddit.My name is _PERSON_, I'm 20 and from the UK, currently in my second year of a UK top 20 University. I also study distance learning at the Open University at the same time to further my skills in something I feel was lacking.I'm very selfless. I will give my lunch to you even if I haven't eaten in days. I live for others to be happy and screw myself over if it makes someone else happy as a result.My closest friend who was an American national, studying abroad, introduced me to a girl way back in January of 2010.  We got talking and we eventually got together sometime in the February. We had a really good relationship together, she was rather sensible and had a good cheery personality, albeit bipolar from time to time.Then in mid december, the final week of my semester, I have two assignments to be completed and a test by the end of the week. I was consistently pulling all-nighters to get the work in on time due to unfair deadlines for submissions. Then she says that she doesn't deserve me because of how well I treat her, and she feels as though she upsets me all the time.Now I have had depression since 2007 so it was commonplace for me to feel upset a bunch of the time.We manage to ride that little storm, and on new year's eve, she commented on a status I had put for new years, replying to my american friend who also commented on it. It simply said ""I'm going to win that bet!""So, me being a little curious, I ask her what the bet was.She was honest and said that she and my best friend had a bet on our relationship. He, betting against us, and she betting for us.I got angry because of this. Because 1, she never was very open about it, and had no intention of telling me unless I had asked, considering that bet had been made a week prior, and 2, betting on a relationship lasting or failing is just plain wrong.The next day, after new year's has been celebrated and what not. I speak to her to figure out what the hell went on. She mentions that we can't be together anymore. I cry and get upset at this because she said she just doesn't love me anymore, even though I had given her everything I possibly could. I tell her not to talk to me until she has a good reason to.A week later. She begins to talk to me, checking up on me because of some worrying behaviour she had caught from me being around online.I ask her again why she just stopped loving me. She said, as bluntly as she had ever been with me, it was because she had never loved me, she tried to force herself to love me but couldn't because she loved my best friend and was trying to go for him.I felt crushed, defeated, horrified, and just the worst I had felt in a very long time. The fact she then said I should just ""deal with it"" upset me further.I'm a person with a declining social life, and having this happen to me is making things 100 times worse. I just feel so horrible still to this day. It's been nearly a week now since it happened. I can't sleep properly. I'm eating at most, 1 meal a day, and just drinking constant energy drinks. I have exams currently so focusing on them is very difficult. I just have feelings of just giving up.I have had a dwindling social life for a while. I could effectively get rid of my phone and no one would know. No one speaks to me on it.I just feel so horrible about it all. I feel ashamed, angry, deeply upset and just so alone.I've just had no determination or drive to do anything of recent. Some of the day's I haven't even left my bed. Starting to get those horrible feelings of suicide and self harm back in my head after not being there for a considerable amount of time. I'm trying to get better, and get out of depression but it is just getting worse and worse. I feel awful right now.Sure, you might say I'm doing well for myself, because I'm at a good university. I don't feel that pride, and I've never been able to. My parents simply did not approve of me going to university, with their old fashioned ""must get a job at 16"" ideology. I'm constantly reminded of it.I honestly feel like I don't deserve where I am. I have nothing to offer what millions of others haven't got. Apart for the fact I have never had a paid job in my life, because I took studies very seriously and didn't want a job to ultimately cause me to drop a grade or two.This probably makes no sense whatsoever, but I'm going to post anyway.I have an exam at 2pm today, it's currently 3am and I just have no intention of sleeping. I've been living off extreme lack of sleep in the past few days yet I'm not tired at all. I'm just giving up on the studies I used to find incredibly fascinating and enjoying, due to all of this. I just don't have any drive to succeed in life anymore.I'm being pushed to the edge by everything going on in my life right now, being tested from all fronts, and I just don't know if I can hold on through it.",0,6,969,start guess explain revealing people person account reddit person uk year uk top university study distance learning open university time skills feel lacking selfless give lunch eaten days live happy screw makes happy result closest friend american national studying abroad introduced girl back january talking eventually february good relationship good cheery personality albeit bipolar time time mid december final week semester assignments completed test end week consistently pulling nighters work time due unfair deadlines submissions deserve treat feels upsets time depression commonplace feel upset bunch time manage ride storm year eve commented status put years replying american friend commented simply win bet curious bet honest friend bet relationship betting betting angry open intention telling asked bet made week prior betting relationship lasting failing plain wrong day year celebrated speak figure hell mentions anymore cry upset love anymore possibly talk good reason week begins talk checking worrying behaviour caught online stopped loving bluntly loved force love loved friend felt crushed defeated horrified worst felt long time fact deal upset person declining social life happen making things times worse feel horrible day week happened sleep properly eating meal day drinking constant energy drinks exams focusing difficult feelings giving dwindling social life effectively rid phone speaks feel horrible feel ashamed angry deeply upset ve determination drive recent day left bed starting horrible feelings suicide harm back head considerable amount time depression worse worse feel awful good university feel pride parents simply approve university fashioned job ideology constantly reminded honestly feel deserve offer millions fact paid job life studies job ultimately drop grade makes sense whatsoever post exam pm today intention sleeping living extreme lack sleep past days tired giving studies find incredibly fascinating enjoying due drive succeed life anymore pushed edge life tested fronts hold,49.0,35.0,21,35,12,18,22,21,8,29
356,"Hi all. My name is _PERSON_, and I have posted here before.On my way home today I thought it may be a good idea to help others and explain my story.I had posted here around 9 months ago, with the following post:_URL_ felt really awful about things going on in my life, and didn't really feel like doing much about it. I just felt like I was going nowhere and I behaved as such. Isolating myself from everyone, not talking to people, acting mopey etc.After some talking with someone from SW and others. I had then taken the step to visit a councillor and try to see if it would help with my problems. Also around this time, I took up doing my favourite sports again (something I had stopped a long time ago) and began talking to a friend of a friend.As time went on, that friend become an important part in helping me feel better and be able to put that smile back on my face.On reflection on things. They have gotten significantly better in the time since I had spoken to the councillor and taken the steps to improve myself, even if before that, I felt like it was going to be a useless waste of time and that I couldn't pull myself from it.Next time you think that things can't get better for you, they really can, and your life can be significantly better for you if you take the time and the steps to help yourself! I cannot stress this enough. It was hard enough for me to just ""take a night off"" from work, as I was just using it as a shield for my own unhappiness even though it was killing me to keep working.Since all of those events had occurred, things have picked up so much.

I feel like when she, who was so incredible, met me, who had nothing and was nothing, all I had to give her was my heart, and she didn't take it. She took me as a friend and defended me when I needed it most. I now have money, a car, a motorcycle, and would still gladly fall on my sword for her.I know that I will never see her again. Somehow, despite having all these things and still loving her more than ever, I feel like I need to compensate just to get people to like me now.

359,"So I just got back from standing on top of a multi-story parking garage, standing on the wall, looking down, and being sorely tempted to jump.I have no history of mental illness, have done nothing too terrible to anyone in terms of rape-murder-war crimes-etc., and in fact I've done my fair share to try and help people. I admit in full disclosure I've contemplated suicide once before, and with the help of a friend backed down. This was quite a few years ago, and I was hoping that things would improve with a consistent and solid effort. They haven't; they've gotten worse.I am a thinker. Not in the philosophy-student way, but in terms of someone who sits and critically analyzes a situation on a deeper level. At this point, I think it's getting too painful to keep moving forward. I feel like with each passing year, my goal of graduating gets further away, not closer.I must confide in you what I have not confided to many others. My parents beat and neglected me as a child. To them, I was nothing but a problem. Shove pills in it and whack it like a pinata until it stops dragging us to parent-administration meetings about his latest misbehavior. That was the kind of attitude given to my mother, and that's how she treated me. I'll die before I do something like that, or treat anyone else like that.I resent that my father only began caring that I exist because it came out my sister is gay, at which point he remembered that I exist as a person. I resent his patronage. I always felt like everyone else was given a handbook on ""how to be normal,"" and ""how to relate to other people,"" and a few other ""obvious"" things that I never got the memo on. Frankly, I have never fit in. At times I can pretend I'm okay with being me. I like me. But I hate the fact that I feel like for all the best intentions, as I tried to grow out of what my childhood had been like (despite outward appearances), I did far more harm than good. I feel like a majority of people I interacted with would agree. I said the dumbest things. I hurt a lot of people entirely by accident, with words or actions I didn't think would have such a profound effect, as I was still learning to at least pretend to relate to other people.In fact, it seems so easy to hurt people I'm tempted to just go full-evil on society, knock it down and re-build it in a way that makes sense to me. The appeal is in more constant reminders of how I've been locked out of a society that doesn't seem to want any part of me.So what say you?",0,6,471,back standing top multi story parking garage standing wall sorely tempted jump history mental illness terrible terms rape murder war crimes fact fair share people admit full disclosure contemplated suicide friend backed years ago hoping things improve consistent solid effort haven worse thinker philosophy student terms sits critically analyzes situation deeper level point painful moving forward feel passing year goal graduating closer confide confided parents beat neglected child problem shove pills whack pinata stops dragging parent administration meetings latest misbehavior kind attitude mother treated die treat resent father began caring exist sister gay point remembered exist person resent patronage felt handbook normal relate people obvious things memo frankly fit times pretend hate fact feel intentions grow childhood outward appearances harm good feel majority people interacted agree dumbest things hurt lot people accident words actions profound effect learning pretend relate people fact easy hurt people tempted full evil society knock build makes sense appeal constant reminders locked society part,31.0,28.0,16,9,9,17,12,18,5,20

363,"I'm a 22 year old male. I graduated college last summer, and I'm still currently unemployed after months of job searching. I don't have my driver's license. I have very few friends. I have an addiction to pornography. I rarely leave leave my house. I live in an affluent neighborhood. I think I've always hated my parents....and I just finished masturbating twice today, and I think I truly want to end my life.I'm aware that there are many people in the world who would love to trade places with me. However, today seems to be my breaking point; my introduction to complete insanity. It all started with an argument with my mother. She spent 10 minutes picking out a loaf of bread that didn't have a ""dark crust."" The store was unusually busy, so there were plenty of shoppers that were trying to get by my mom as she was scrutinizing every loaf of bread on the shelf. At this point, I just erupted and argued that this was entirely pointless, especially since my mom ends up peeling the crust away from the bread and throwing it away. But as always, she got mad and refused to talk to me the rest of the time at the store and during the way home. When we finally arrived home, she told me that she never wanted me to go shopping with her ever again because I was complete nuisance. My mother, and I always have arguments like this; they're always about petty things and she always stops talking to me, never giving me a chance to explain or even listen to my reasoning. In fact, most of my life has been this cycle of arguments. The nature of the arguments is completely stupid, so much so, that I'm having regrets about mentioning this because I'm sure people will think that I'm just an immature idiot. But, today was just the final straw. I've had enough of this shit. I live in one of the leading tech-centers in the world. A place where high school kids are building apps and making their first million at 20 years old. A place that loves the whole ""young-entrepreneur"" image, engineers, doctors, and lawyers. In my high school, many of the students are the sons and daughters of parents who work in the previously mentioned fields, or are professors at a prestigious local university. My parents are both undocumented immigrants. Because of their status, both of them lead isolated lives, which meant I've mostly led an isolated life for the most part. My parents have no hobbies, at least I've never seen them do any activity that remotely resembles a hobby. I guess watching t.v. sort of counts. Neither of them went to college. My father works a dead-end job at a grocery store, while my mother works as a babysitter. Neither of them understood the type of environment they were going to raise their kid in. They didn't understand the competitive nature of the education system or the workforce. My father grew up dirt poor in a family of 11 other siblings. My mother grew up in better conditions, but was dominated by her father. Her father imposed his will on the entire family, even if some his decisions seemed irrational the rest of the family. He was abused as a kid, and subsequently he instilled a culture of fear into my mother, always making her see the dangers of the outside world and emphasizing the ""safe-haven"" of family. My mother passed on the same fear culture to me. I have never met any of my extended family members either. No. It's just been me, my mom, and my dad for 22 years of my life. My childhood wasn't bad. It was a normal childhood, you know, except for the constant reminder from my mother that the world is bad,and  I could die at any moment. I was forbidden from riding a bicycle because I could die. I had quite a lot of friends and was somewhat outgoing. Everything seemed alright until I reached high school. High school was really the time where my life began going downhill, I think. I began to really notice how pathetic I was; how isolated I was. While peers discussed their trips to x and y countries, I always talked about how ""it was nice staying home."" I also began to notice how ignorant I was about the education system and how to get into college. My parents always told that I was intelligent, but never talked to me about how to handle failure. So by the time _PERSON_'s, and the harder classes began to come around, I felt like an utter failure; I felt stupid. If I was so damn ""intelligent,"" why was struggling all of a sudden? My parents never talked to me about working hard and their knowledge of school was archaic. I believed that people were either born intelligent or they weren't. And I was beginning to believe that I was part of the latter. I didn't know that the rest of peers could afford cram classes, private tutors, _PERSON_ classes, or simply that their parents were more educated and they could give them advice through the rigors of school. I was completely lost. I wasn't doing well academically in high school, and I sure as hell wasn't doing well socially. I was never a popular kid, but I did have a group of friends and could talk with almost anyone I met. I ""floated around,"" if you will. However, my social skills went in complete decline when I became acquainted with pornography. In high school, my parents were barely home and with the stress of school, pornography turned from an innocent discovery, to a form of self-medication for my problems. I was watching and masturbating so frequently that I became depressed and exhausted. Unfortunately, I'm talking in hindsight because at the time, I had no idea that my obsessive porn and masturbation habits were causing me so much pain. Even through my depression, I kept masturbating and watching porn thinking that it was the only source of ""happiness"" in  my life. I never had any romantic experiences with any females, even up to today. Eventually my grades began to really decrease, I was just miserable. College wasn't any different. It was a constant battle between my depression and my confidence. By this point, I was completely isolated myself from friends and most people. I barely went outside to socialize. I usually stayed in my dorm to watch porn, masturbate, and watch youtube videos. It wasn't until I reached my senior year of college that I realized porn was a problem, and I decided that I NEEDED to cut it from my life. I promised myself that after I graduated, I would work on eliminating my addiction.The summer of my graduation, I was pumped to go into my recovery. I quickly sought treatment. I had a plan ready to go: I would work a part time job working a regular job at a restaurant or retail, study japanese (I wanted to spend a year teaching English in Japan), workout, and just spend time improving myself before I would step out and go after a real job. However, my father had different plans. He wanted me to get a ""real job"" right off the bat because he thought that having graduated college automatically made me entitled to getting a job. I told him about my plan, but he refused to listen and partially convinced me, ""hey, I did spend a lot of my on that degree. I should be getting a job with better pay."" Well, it wasn't long before I began to feel frustrated as I wasn't getting calls back from any of the places I applied to. Months went by and no luck. Mixed in that time, more arguments with my mom about stupid shit. And then, I began to start peeking at porn again and little by little I began to relapse again and again and again. This leads me to today. One stupid argument later, and I'm out again wasting my seed on pixels and adding to my depressive symptoms. I'm still unemployed, and feeling absolutely helpless. i feel like there's no way out of this cycle. I feel especially shameful that I've recently visited my old high school to talk to kids about going to college and trying to motivate them, when I'm struggling to deal with my own stupid problems. I feel like such a hypocrite trying to help people when I can't even help myself. I don't know what to do anymore. I've spent more than 8 months trying to combat my addiction to porn and better my life, and all I can show for it is my cum-stained boxers... This is the first time I've ever truly thought about suicide. I don't know where to go or what to do...how do I go forward with my life???.....please...I really need help...I'm tired of feeling helpless...TLDR;I'm a loser who's currently unemployed. I had a stupid argument with my mother that sent me over the edge. I lost control and broke my vow of eliminating my addiction to pornography and masturbation.

367,"Not really sure what to say and where to start, as much as I would love to have that crystal clear explanation that everyone understands - I just don't have one. I've dealt with depression for the majority of my life, I've been on medications before but they didn't really increase the 'highs' or decrease the 'lows'; just leveled me out.  I've been to a pastor (I'm atheist), a psychiatrist, long-term counselling and sought the advice of everyone around me but it all boils down to no one really understands. Friends and family can maintain that whenever I need help I can seek them out but they can't understand - they can't empathize being alone because none of them are. I have a suspicion that there is only so much the can take before they aren't there anymore. And I'm aware that having these people to contact does help, but they have their own lives and I can't expect them to take this on.  No one knows where my heads at currently, my siblings are supportive but can't seem to grasp that this isn't being love sick over an ex-girlfriend or stressed about my job. My parents? they wont react in any useful way unless it directly affects them. I've been recently (trying to) quit drinking both for money and health, but it's becoming increasing difficult to cope without it. I almost laugh at the idea that I wanted to be a police officer and help people, I couldn't bare the idea of this stuff coming out in a mental exam or a polygraph. Nor would they ever allow someone like me in that sort of role.  Instead here I set unable to sleep yet again, wondering if any strangers had advice or some magic set of words that can snap me out of it.  Since my girlfriend left 8 months ago citing she doesn't love me anymore, I've clung to my hobbies and work like a security blanket. Things that used to fulfill me no longer do, work has become a haze of my feeling inadequate and unable to cope.All I want to do his talk to her again and try to make sense of it all as if she alone had the answer. My sister maintains that while I might find what I'm looking for - my ex can just as easily ignore me which would probably deal more damage.Work is probably the one good thing I have going, i enjoy the challenge of it all - but as team members leave, more and more is being dropped on me. Which because I get overwhelmed and cannot cope ruins what little faith I had that I can do this job.I'm aware enough to know that the finality of death is not something I should actively seek, I just want it to be over - to not have to worry, be anxious or think about where I went wrong. How regardless of what people think, it IS too late for some things and the clock is only ticking further.I'm rambling, not really sure what to do at this point. Just needed to get my thoughts out.

He is depressed, socially isolated, estranged from his family, his life has basically fallen apart over the past 15 years (failed academics, failed career, failed marriage). Burned lots of bridges over the years. He's working part time and just barely struggling to make it through each day financially, physically, emotionally. He's not receiving any mental health treatment/meds _PERSON_ have kept in regular e-mail contact with him, exchanging messages every several days. As per the talking tips from the sidebar, I've focused on trying to maintain rapport, empathizing, not judging. I thought this was going alright for a while, but he's reached the point where he literally sees no hope that things can improve, but he's not brave enough to end his life. I'm empathizing with that, not telling him ""it's not that bad"". Honestly, his life actually is pretty bad, at least measured by what he'd wanted for his life. I know that he can still find some happiness in his life (albeit with drastically lower expectations, but I don't say that, of course). My basic message is that even though things are really bad, if he can just survive each day, then he can give himself a chance for things to get better.For years, he's said he has no reason to go on living, but has never acted on it. But recently, he sounds like he is saying goodbye to me, thanking me for my friendship, that kind of thing. This has been going on for a few weeks now, but I still managed to keep him communicating. But his last messages have gone even more downhill, like he has to start looking for a painless way to go, wondering if he will have better luck in the ""next life"".Not sure what I should do at this point. I gave him the Tokyo suicide hotline numbers a long time ago (like 5 years ago) and I could give them to him again, but at this point, I don't think he would even use it. He's just given up.I wonder if I should advise he get professional help. I don't know if there is any way to compel treatment or even if that is possible in Japan without family involvement (as I mentioned, he's estranged from his family). We (other friends and I) have tried intervening in the past, but it just resulted in him getting angry/resentful and cutting off contact (the whole people not understanding him). So making that kind of direct appeal or action seems to go against the talking tips of empathizing and not judging.So, yeah, not sure if I should be writing something more direct, trying to take direct action, or even if those things are possible or advisable.Any insights/advice you can provide would be appreciated.**TL;DR--friend on another continent is suicidal and I am out of ideas/time/options**",0,11,499,advance impending wall text friend living country japan born raised depressed socially isolated estranged family life basically fallen past years failed academics failed career failed marriage burned lots bridges years working part time barely struggling make day financially physically emotionally receiving mental health treatment meds person regular mail contact exchanging messages days talking tips sidebar focused maintain rapport empathizing judging thought alright reached point literally sees hope things improve brave end life empathizing telling bad honestly life pretty bad measured wanted life find happiness life albeit drastically lower expectations basic message things bad survive day give chance things years reason living acted recently sounds goodbye thanking friendship kind thing weeks managed communicating messages downhill start painless wondering luck life point gave tokyo suicide hotline numbers long time ago years ago give point advise professional compel treatment japan family involvement mentioned estranged family friends intervening past resulted angry resentful cutting contact people understanding making kind direct appeal action talking tips empathizing judging yeah writing direct direct action things advisable insights advice provide appreciated tl dr friend continent suicidal ideas time options,28.0,13.0,10,18,6,10,13,9,5,16

390,"I don't really know where to start. I feel absolutely hopeless. Worthless. I enjoy next to nothing anymore. I've been clinically depressed for over a year now, and recently it's only gotten worse. I am filled with guilt and dread over the things that I've done or said. Suicide is the answer for me. My boyfriend left because of my shitty actions. My parents hate me; my mother is in love with only herself and claims zero fault. Every time we argue she never fails to let me know that I'm spoiled and manipulative and a bitch. Recently she screamed at me telling me I'm 'ruining everything' as she has just moved back in with my father and I. My dad physically attacked me when I called her stupid (because he's never heard the verbal abuse she's pulled on me, so I was in the wrong. Obviously) and I now have a huge problem looking directly at him. I am 18 so I'm aware I can move out, yet as the only child, they have guilted me into staying at home, blaming the fact that we dont have enough money for me to live with my friends (though I've stated that by summer I'll have saved enough from my job that I could leave if I wanted to. They only make other excuses.) They use the fact that we moved states 'for me', only furthering the guilt and making me feel as though I owe them.The comunity college here is shitty; I refuse to feel any more of a burden by asking my parents to pay for my out-of-state tuition.I was refused by a great daycare place because of my past suicide attempts. They deemed me too unstable to work with children which absolutely destroyed me, as I looked forward to meeting coworkers my age and making kids days better. I've applied to five other places, and it makes me sad that no one has called me back yet. My mother tells me I'm supposed to help the family, and I have be applying for five jobs in a two week period, yet she sits on her ass all day relying on her retirement check and my father to support her.My ex can never decide if he wants to be with me or not, which is mentally and emotionally draining. He's truly a great guy but younger than me, so he's very confused on everything. He saved me from an abusive ex and we get along together so fantastically, yet he left because I can be a real bitch sometimes-my words, not his- and I have a problem with lashing out when I'm angry or sad.Every part of my body is literally weighed down by this depression. My head constantly hurts. I'm too guilty and tired to eat. I'm too depressed to work out like I normally do. The medicine they have me on only helps slightly. I feel that for me to be important other people have to want me, and it feels like nobody wants me so my self talk is complete shit. I literally see no point for me to be alive. I believe everybody has potential and a story. Maybe _PERSON_ intended my story to end in suicide. I'd love to be a clinical psych and help other children and adults like myself but I just cannot find the strength to push forward anymore. I'm drained. I'm so tired. I wake up to the thought of suicide. I go to bed with the thought of suicide. I found a site that said short suspension hanging is less painful than any other method of suicide. I don't know what to do. I see little reason for me to be alive at this point in time. I'm tired of the ""it gets better bullshit"".

It's quite a while, but for a suicidal person, having something to look forward to is good, isn't it? There's also an event in May I look very much forward too as well. Also, next month, new season of a tv show I like a lot. See, I have things to look forward to, I have things that makes me happy. Like my cats, gaming, music. Still I keep thinking about wanting to die. I don't want to leave my boyfriend or my family behind, so deep inside me I don't want to die at all. It's especially when people ask me what I want to do with life, when am I gonna stop gaming all night, what will you work with, why did you drop out of school and what will you do now. All kinds of questions. I dropped out of school recently because it was difficult as hell to go there and I gave up. It's my second time dropping out, now I have given up. At least here in Norway I know I won't end up on the street, we always get money to survive and a place to stay even if we're unable to afford it ourselves. That's what I've learnt at least. I have no idea what to work with, I can't handle anything. I hate humans and I hate most things, and then I hate myself for hating all of it and I can't stop myself from it either. I enjoy sitting up all night and gaming while I talk to my teammates on skype. I enjoy being at home and just chilling with my computer and my cats. I know very well I can't just do this my whole life, no need to tell me what I already know. But whenever I get asked those questions I mentioned over, or I just end up thinking about them, all these suicidal thoughts come. I know that I won't live until I get old unless I get help for this, lots of help. I went to therapy once before, lived in a clinic for depressed/anxious/self harming/suicidal etc people. I applied to move into one again to get help, I went to get help by my own will, because I am afraid that I might end up killing myself when I'm at my worst, because I tend to forget everything positive and it might go wrong.Am I really stupid for this? Do I deserve to die? I feel like I do because I am so filled with negativity. Is there any self-help methods I can do at least until I get to hear from the clinic I applied to? What if I don't get to move into there? I am very bad at telling people exactly how I feel and I make it sound like it's not as bad as I feel inside me, and the doctor who wrote the application for me was Danish so it was a bit difficult to communicate too. If I don't get in, I don't even know what to do. I am just afraid to kill myself, because I don't want to leave people behind me, hurt because of their loss. That's my main reason to stay alive.

399,"How can the right road always be the saddest one? Will that ever stop? I think have emotions on a scale 10x what most people do. its also impossible to make anyone understand what experiencing that on a daily basis is like. What a sad thought, sharing your mind with your own worst enemy.I was born with so much joy and awe in me. I was molested by my older brother as a little girl. I don't know exactly how old, 8, 9? I never understood. When I did, I could not tell anyone. I couldn't hurt my family that way. After, I became convinced something was wrong with my body from it. I was too young to understand. I thought no one would ever love me. I planned to kill myself before I got old enough for people to find out. I cried every night12 &amp; 13 I watched my older sister suffer under anorexia. We shared a room together and I would hear her weep when she thought I was asleep. She would get up in the dark and exercise. My parents were overwhelmed and I was understandably unimportant in those circumstances. Looking back now I see how much help I needed, going into adolescence very lonely and sad. At 15 I met a boy who had just turned 17. Over the next 3 years, he became my best friend and I loved him, so much. He had difficult problems with mental illness (severe depression, maybe schizophrenia). By the time I was 17 (2010), he had tried to kill himself many times and I was at the end of my rope in distress. I didn't know how to help anymore. May 2010 he found his mother dead, suddenly. He started having horrible nightmares and fear and things got worse. After a serious attempt, I finally asked him to at least tell me next time so that I could say goodbye. He did. On Oct. 2nd he instant messaged me... it is hard to describe this conversation. He had taken 208 pills (I can never forget these things). I talked to him as he died. as he told me about his arms going numb. I wept and wept and asked him how was I supposed to go on? how could I ever laugh again? I knew I could intervene but I didn't. I had watched him suffer so long. I let him die. There is a father out there who lost his wife and his son in the same year. That will always be my burden. it will always be what I did.I almost cannot remember the darkness of the following winter. I was so ashamed and kept so much secret. few people knew what I was dealing with. 21 now, but the pain from this has barely faded, and the damage is permanent. I search desperately for a sense of security in my relationships. i am in terror of being abandoned, and yet I find myself so often crushingly alone.A two and a half year relationship that I would do anything, anything I could to fix has just fallen apart because of struggles with mental illness. He told me over and over that he did not have the ability to be with anyone in his life right now, and could not give me time or affection. I've spent the last few months in silence without him, struggling to stay above my demons. This week he messaged me with only painful things to say. He fucked someone new. im crushed and I can't understand. He's left me in silence againnow I can't cause myself enough physical pain to feel calm. i'm beating myself to nothing, my legs are covered in dark bruises. all my joy is gone and I try to keep going through every day with wave after wave of black pain. I have wanted so so badly to die for years. The people I love have no idea how much love it takes to keep going every day. I did not want to do to them what I have experienced.

But this year, through a combination of stress, severe ADD, and inability I've more or less annihilated any chance of scholarships or getting into a good college.  I have no desire to waste the college money my parents have put forth.My parents are married, but my father has never really been in my life.  Just today I was in a concert that we've practiced months for, but my dad decided not to come and he didn't ask me about it when I got back. This kind of detachment has been present with him my whole life. My mother might have loved me, but my recent (in)action to fix my life have only driven her further away, and she is even more wrathful and depressed because of me.Additionaly, I have no close friends as I am very awkward and withdrawn, and I can't recall even being invited to ""hang out"" with anyone since middle school.I had about a year long relationship with my girlfriend, who I still love dearly, but I kept this secret from most everyone as she and her parents are atheists, and I feared my parents reaction.  Last weekend I broke things off, though, because I've been under so much stress that it overtakes her whenever we're together, which is profoundly unfair to her.I've witnessed my parents marriage go from stagnant to deteriorating over the last few months, and almost guarantee it is a product of the stress I have brought them.

I don't know what the hell happened between us, all I remember was us getting into an argument than ending the friendship. But the more I look back on it, I didn't realize how crazy she was and how much she emotionally toyed with me. Regardless, I'm far over her now. Then there was the fact I guess I was bullied all throughout my childhood. And raped repeatedly as a kid. (Though to be honest I even question myself from time to time whether i was raped or not since my memory is a blur of the incident.)I guess what I'm afraid of is being emotionally toyed with again.

423,"My name is cassie, im 15. Ive been cutting since i was 12. Im naturally a protective, caring , and sensitive person. Ever since i was young i was always called ugly and fat, after hearing it so many times u start to believe it, even on days when i feel like i look good i refuse to believe it cause of how many times i heard im ugly. My mom is _PERSON_ and shes been through so much shit. Her dad was abusive, but then again we are hispanic and our discipline is tough. but even then, thats no excuse for wat hes done to her. When i was younger i used to adore and love my aunts and uncles...now...should my mom ever die and i have to invite her sibilings, and i see them crying, i will curse them and beat them. Because of one of my aunts telling a lie my grandpa (or the ""fkin asshole that should rot in hell"") he told my mom to get on her knees one day, and he put on some steel tipped boots, and kicked her back out. On her graduation day from highschool she couldnt walk. Hes kept her from going out with her sisters and so many other things, he is a real asshole. I hate him and he hates me, my mom, my step dad, and my lil bro even. My real dad left when i was young and he is an ass. Ya he used to pick me up and be with me but he was always busy with some other shit then instead of really spending time with me. he has always been a smoker and drinks beer like there no tomorrow... He's hurt me so many times and has filled me with promises that he immediately breaks afterward and has let me down on so many occasions. He is the reason i started cutting. And to be honest, im just wating for him to die....he has lost so much weight and looks so thin, really like a skeleton, and im just waiting for him to die. Itz been 2-3 years when i havent really spent time with him, and i refuse to call him, or txt him unless we need the child support check from him. Recently his mom died, i didnt realy care his famiy doesnt approve of me, they call me fat and do not like that i dont eat spicy food. They also dont like my mom and his mom treated my mom bad. He guilted me into spending time with him.  He cried and everything i felt really bad so i had no choice but to be with him.  He's even forgotten my birthday, and doesnt really even know me. The only thing i can thank him for is getting me into SFX make up thats about it. And i know people think its no big deal who cares he forgot ur b-day. But hispanics (or at least my family) are known for parties or b-day parties. and when i was with my dad it was because of my cuzins or families b-days, they never did things for my bday like for my family members.  I adore my step dad, i love him like he was my real dad! He takes cares of me and truly cares for me he is my moms knight in shining armor, and i tell him more than i tell my mom, i trust him, i really do. His family accepts me, but his mom and my mom clash heads alot. The only thing is they don't know my name but call me _PERSON_ (not really my name, but close enough). We generally are a close and open family, but lately...I dont know. I've always been strange, i Wanted to have glasses, i Wanted to have braces. Something funny is when i actually need them my mom thought i was lying, i wasnt...right now my perscription is -4.00 and i have astigmatism in my right eye (kitty eye)! In my moms half of the family, diabetes, anxiety &amp; panic attacks,  low blood pressure, and chronic migraines.  Im already starting to get migraines and the anxiety/panic attacks but i just ignore the attacks and take exedrin for the migraines. But despite all this i sometimes feel really low, i call it cruising blue. Sometimes i have my highs and feel good, which is why i think i might be bipolar. i told my (step)dad a few weeks ago and he understood me, and i showed him my scars, he knew about them before, but i havent been to anyone to see if i am bipolar. I wanna remind him again, but because of money issues i just wanna wait it out untill i cant control it. I started the butterfly project...im doing ok so far despite a few stupid things i did this and last week ( i carved  a heart on my hip and butterfly on my upper thigh cause i felt guilty i didnt go to my godmothers moms wake ,even thought i dont know her). I have thought and tried to commit suicide a few times my mom even claims i overdosed once, but i dont think so. My mom is christian, my dad catholic, and my stepdad Jehovah's witness. I was baptized catholic even though i know nothing catholic, only christian. I am afraid to go to hell even though i know ive done alot of bad. And i've made promises i wont commit suicide. I just sometimes feel so so tired and i feel like i wanna sleep forever. I need someone to talk to, someone to vent to i guess.

425,"Hello /r/SuicideWatch , I come to you bearing some news that may not be unfamiliar to you all, but nonetheless still saddening. I have been friends with this girl for 4 years now, me and her even had a short dating history. It has been roughly 2 years since our break up and we have been decent friends since then. Enough about us.I came here Tonight to ask for help. About 2 years ago her parents divorced because her mother was cheating on her father.  This is when she started having massive Anxiety attacks. Six months after we broke up she got a new boyfriends things were going great for them. Then suddenly he starts being a complete ass to her and cheats on her. This made her tip over the edge for a month or two. She quickly got another boyfriend. Here is the Catch though. The boyfriend is her mothers boyfriend's son.  They were going good for about 3 months, then she was told she was not allowed to go to college because of her mom failing to submit the financial aid papers. This just added onto her issues.Fast forward to the last two to three weeks. She is now in college, but failing all of her classes. Her boyfriend is distancing herself from him, partially because her mother broke up with his father. Here is the kicker... Her mother is blaming her for the break up, saying it is her fault. She has said things ""You need to cheer up you are such a downer"", ""get a grip"", ""you need to be happy"".  Plus her sister is completely out of hand ( I would be here all night trying to explain what is wrong with her). Just last week we found out her mother is seeing another guy (The mother hadn't broken up with the boyfriend at this time). To top it all off my friend now has Anxiety, an Attachment Disorder (Anxiety from  having no familiar around), and I say she is depressed. She is scared to tell her Therapist that she is suicidal because she will get kicked out of school and won't be able to return.  She has told me multiple times in the last week that she wants to kill herself, but doesn't want that in-between life and death (so pills out of the question i hope..)., She said she has contemplated not drinking water, not eating, _PERSON_ monoxide poisoning... She constantly says no one cares, which isn't true me and three of her close friends constantly tell her that we care...which doesn't since the three people she wants to care(mom, and boyfriend, dad) don't seem to give a rats ass about her. She constantly says that each day the part that is scared to commit suicide shrinks..which scares me a lot.... Also, she constantly says no one will miss her when she is gone. I tell her i do, but she then replies ""You only will for a few weeks"". So what i came here for was some advice, for what I could do when talking to her... I really want to call her Mother and yell at her... she knows her daughter is suicidal... but doesn't seem to care... I care about her so much, I have tried giving her advice from when I was suicidal...._PERSON_ had a good network of people around me though), but she rejects them...I can't seem to get through to her...P.S. I am sorry for the poor _PERSON_ and spelling it is currently 12:30 AM where I live and I'm very tired...I probably won't be able to reply till morning because i feel I am about to pass out.

Yet every single time it usually ends up them just not responding to my texts a few days later.  I know that people can go through funks, but it seems that from the law of averages, I should have at least gotten a second date.  All of these experiences are starting to make me feel like I am doing something horribly wrong and offending people.

427,"Hi. I'm a 19-year-old guy who immigrated to the US 10 months ago. I've been depressed for 3 years now, and suicidal for 2 years.Basically, as the title says, I don't have one single reason left to live on. There is no point. Let me tell you why.My parents are struggling financially. _PERSON_ is 60, and mom is 54 years old and they are both working at really tiring retail jobs. We barely make enough money for rent. We have to use the money we saved before immigration to pay for other expenses. Of course, that money won't last forever.It was my dream to come here, but nothing is going OK right now. I sometimes even think maybe this was a mistake.My parents came with us to help us financially so we could go to college. I have to work to pay for a community college. I don't even know how to pay for tuition when I transfer to a 4-year college. My parents surely can't do that for me.My twin brother abuses me physically, verbally and emotionally nearly every day and I can't live at somewhere else because I can't afford it.I have no friends so I can't talk to anyone when I'm alone or suicidal. Therapy is not working, I got used to my meds, and I don't have insurance so I can't go to the hospital if I become suicidal to get help.I am not that attractive, I am skinny fat and basically it fucks my confidence up. I have moobs and a beer belly (although I rarely drink) and am really hairy, so I am 100% sure no girl will ever like me. I've never had a girlfriend before and I'm a virgin. I know I will be alone forever and die a virgin.I also have hypospadias, a birth defect on my penis. I hate it. Girls will surely freak out if they ever see it. I also can't orgasm. So sex would be a nightmare for me AND my partner, if I ever had one of course.I see everyone around me having amazing cars and big ass houses and hot wives/husbands and doing everything that I want to but can't. Everyone is rich, everyone is hot, everyone has fancy clothes, everyone is in relationship (and probably getting laid), everyone is going out at night or doing other stuff and having fun. They are LIVING.I am not. I never will. My dreams won't work out. There is no hope. I've been trying for 3 years.

431,"Okay people, this might be a long one and it might be a little disjointed because I'm trying to gather my thoughts together. I'm a 20 year old male ( will be 21 in July) and I believe I have a case of an nmom. I believe (I know for a fact) my mom has always resented me since birth because I wasn't meant to happen (she stated that) and because she tried putting me up for adoption and the only reason why i wasn't sent to an adoption home is because my great grandma (who was adopted kid) intervened and didnt want me to live a similar life to what she lived (I was told this in 10 grade and my mom dosent know I know this) and with that info it explains how she treats me compared to my older brother and in general . So let's summarize my life and give an in depth description of my situation. Throughout my entire life my mom has always treated my brother better then me and has had an overall bias for him. Whether it be buying him new clothes and giving me hand me downs (which occurred all the way up til 11 grade due to me getting a ""job"") or just by the way she handled problems differently between us (I would get more severe punishments)  Another thing is she's never really payed any attention to me (she saids I had good grades but I had a 2.5 gpa in highschool which I'll explain) and I feel she takes out her anger on me due to her being in an abusive marriage and being diagnosed with bipolar and a few other things. First let me explain my highschool situation and then we'll fast forward a bit. So in highschool in my freshman year literally the first day of school, I had the most embrassing thing happen to me and because of this it's changed my life and shaped me as a person. On the first day of highschool in art class I pissed my shorts. It was so bad I skipped the next day of school but my brother told me that there was no escaping it because everybody was talking about it so he really didn't want to associate himself with me (but he already didn't associate himself with me due to being around the wrong crowd and getting a felony in middle school ) So throughout my highschool life I was ridiculed and made fun and I just couldn't focus and I was afraid to talk to people because everyone knew it. I was depressed and had no friends there due to just moving  and to top it l off Im black (which I think race plays a part in your highschool life because there's so many stereotypes and people just trying to fit in) So after highschool I proced to go technical school so I could transfer to a unviersty (I was thinking about going into the military at the back of my mind as a last resort , REMBER this) When I was looking for colleges with my mom she was surprised that I had such a low gpa which goes to show you how much attention she had for me. Anyway I was only able to complete one semester of college due to the fact that my mom received an oppurtunity to transfer location for her job a verison wireless to altanta which she took because she took because she wanted to ""be connected"" with the music industry because she a ""manager"" and if you don't know a lot of black people speak highly of altanta. So anyway, I'm pretty much forced to go to altanta because just didn't have any other option because if not I would of ended up like my brother who decided not to come (he's living in a one bedroom apt living cautious due to the job he has not paying much) So I'm living in altanta now with my mom and not knowing the full situation until later. Because apprantly my mom was having half the rent payed by someone she was in a ""relationship"" with before which I thought was over because he was going to later move in lets just call him _PERSON_. So I'm just living life coped in my room withering away because I have no one to talk to, not getting any jobs due to never working, and not being able to go to college due to having no ride or license or even a damn permit. So it hit me "" I got to do something with my life because if not I won't be shit, age 18"" so after 6 months of living in ga with nothing going for me I decided I wanted to join the navy (which I already brought it up to my mom previously) so I take the asvab and scored an 82 and was given a pact firemen job (which I didn't want but took anyway due to the fact I needed to get out my situation because nobody was helping me) So the entire time this is happening my mom starts agitated due to the fact she probably knew the reason that I was leaving because of her. So throughout this period of waiting to get deployed she would start arguements with me and not take me to my DEP meeting forcing my petty officer to. So I finally get into basic training and realized that this life wasn't for me so I tried to push myself but the thing that caught me was I didn't know how to swim and because of that I was in boot camp for 4 months and emotionally broke down and got seperated. So when I made that phone call to my mom telling her what happen she was all supportive (which I think was just an act, because it was more of relief to her  that I tried to do sonething but failed and that I have to depend on her) So after being seperated im back at my moms house and to my surprise my uncle is here and _PERSON_. My mom told me she wanted me to relax on jumping straight into something and that she would help me once I decided to get back into things. So after living there for a few weeks i realized everything wrong with the situation of my mom moving to altanta. Because constantly my mom and _PERSON_ would argue and _PERSON_ would bring up the fact he was paying half the rent while not even living in the house and the fact my mom would never claim they were in a relationship publicly. And whenever either one wasn't around they would talk shit about each other behind each other backs to my uncle, (also when they would argue _PERSON_ would not pay rent out of spite) the whole time im just the non existent one. Fast Forward to my CURRENT SITUATION my mom ends up getting in a relationship with another dude while she was still clinging on to  _PERSON_ (using him for rent) , so _PERSON_ just saids fuck it and moves out and lost all contact with my mom. Now lets get to the bs since my mom is with her new boyfriend lets call him _PERSON_ she has made it very apprant that she dosent like me by talking shit about me to _PERSON_, my brother, _PERSON_s two daughters and my uncle. And when ask her for help she saids ""you'll get no where in life depending on people"" (because she knows I need her help and she's going out of her way to not help me). it's gotten worse because I confronted her about how she talks shit about me (she responded with im just venting, my ass) and isn't really trying to help me, and how it's because of her that my brother  just ignores me. Which didn't work out because this N just disregarded all the points I made and said I disrespected her and proceded to tell my brother, my uncle, and _PERSON_ just so they can have a reason to not help me and to justify the way she treats me. So pretty since my nmom has a stable source of income to leech on she no longer feels the need to pretend to care about me because before with _PERSON_ she still needed me just i case everything hit the fan. So what the fuck do I do, I literally have nothing. Sorry for the long story and disjointness, if there is anything you don't understand/ need more info on just tell me. ~Haze•To Summarize: mom never really liked me, I tried going to the miltaty to get away, emotionally broke down and got seperated, came back and is now dealing with my mom slandering me behind my back and giving people reasons to hate me to justify her reasons of treating me this way.

437,"I'm in college right now, student-athlete, male, age 22. Lately, I've been having almost flashbacks of my school days where I was bullied. In my K-12 years, I was bullied constantly. I suffer from Aspergers syndrome and placed in RSP (program for students with disabilities). Other students knew this and gave me hell for it. I was called things like ""retard"", ""stupid"", ""special ed"", etc. I was physically assualted quite a bit during elementary school and middle school (I had my first suicidal thoughts at the age of 8). During high school it was more verbal, however I did have objects thrown at me. I was even called a retard by my 4th grade teacher for failing a drawing assignment. I was great at history but sucked at mathematics. I used to envy and loathe honor students. Many of the honor students also happened to be the popular kids as well. I was also told things like ""I would never pass middle school"". These events are over, however for some reason they have been tormenting me  recently. My self-worth is low and I'm viewing myself as a ""retard"" again like I did in my K-12 years. Secondly, for some reason I will have a crush on a girl. Then the crush turns into an obsession, then most of my time will be dedicated to thinking about her. These usually happen with girls that I know I can't have. And usually they have certain physical characteristics that I eventually obsess over as well. I usually find black and mixed race (black and something else) women the most attractive. Before that I used to be fixated on redheads, so on and so forth. Recently, I have been fixated on this mixed race girl that i have only met once 6 months ago. Don't even really know her. However, I have been thinking heavily about her recently. She goes to a christian college 400 miles away (I should probably note that I'm agnostic). We had a small talk and she gave me seemingly flirtatious smiles and giggles. Because of this I have been thinking about her heavily know, been totally fixated on her. I recently added her on facebook, but the friend request is still pending (it's been 3 days). Last time this happened it was with another mixed race girl and a black girl before that. It is driving me crazy, and ultimately extremely depressed. I also feel horrible that I'm fixating so much on a womens race, it feels so wrong, but for some reason I find black and mixed race girls extremely attractive. And I feel being fixated on specific girls and a specific race ruins opportunites with potentially awesome women. I feel lost. Lastly, I have been feeling isolated with almost everybody I know. I feel like I can't relate to anybody anymore. I feel like I can't express my feelings with people I know. I have been going to church to find a sense of community, but it's not really helping. I feel alone and isolated. I excersise a lot for my training for my sport. I spend about 2-5 hours each day working out. I lift 3 days a week and do cardio 5-6 days a week(I ran 5 miles yesterday). That provides me with temporary relief. But after that, I feel empty again. I get like this sometimes, but recently has been extremely bad. I don't know if I'm exactly suicidal, but I'm afraid of going down that road again.

488,"My wife isn't suicidal, exactly. She has PTSD, as will as a laundry list of diagnosed and possible other disorders. I can't leave her side, ever. I worry about running to the store. I rarely see family. She did attempt suicide once; I had left to be with my brother and father, I had only been gone one hour. All that saved her was her inexperience at tying knots. She was our primary bread winner until she could no longer work, now i work 3 jobs, including the National Guard. I can't leave, and yet i have to.I love her very much, and happily work myself to death if it would help us. But it doesn't. We're financially circling the drain, which is endlessly frustrating considering my own lack of of sleep, and meals we've both missed just to keep the basics.Every solitary moment i spend, driving from one job to the next or trying to sleep, i fantasize and killing myself now,which seems do strange. Im healthy and strong. I'm young and ambitious. Yet these days just getting sleep is the closest i get to relief.  I wish things like i hope we go to the range this month so they will give me ammo, or may some box will fall off the shelf at work and just end it.I find that I can't live this way. But she will never change, we've tried a lot and are continuing treatment, but nothing seems to help very much. I still can't leave her alone.I can't do the things I enjoy, because I need to keep her as happy as possible at all times. no one else is willing to deal with her, mostly because her family is not a very good family, and she can be very stressful to be around sometimes. Her moods are erratic. But she means well all of the time, that's why I love her. She cares very much about other people.I don't know if I'm making sense, or if this is even the appropriate forum. Is there something I can do to help her that maybe I haven't thought of, or is there something that might help me?

So I looked at the major things I wanted to achieve and worked my ass off to get them. I now have a 3.9 GPA in an engineering degree, a high paying internship at a fortune 500 company, gained 30 lbs lifting weights and through heavy doses of Accutane last year, got rid of my acne. I tried very hard to become more social, gained some friends and have had a couple girlfriends in the last 2.5 years. Yet, all of these great things have piled up so high and now consume such a huge amount of time that I just feel completely buried under it all. I never have a moment to sit down and take a breath. I've worked so hard to get to where I am, but I'm just miserable. From the outside looking in I'm doing fantastic, but from the inside looking out, I've never felt worse.

498,"Here is the direct quoted email:""I enjoyed your presentation today.  It was interesting and well thought out.  YOu received a 15/15. I just wanted to check in with you about how things are going.  Your song topic made me worry a bit and hope that you're not relating too much with Jeremy.  Also, you mentioned in class about your medication, and I wanted to follow up and see how you're doing with that.   I'm not a counselor or a clinician, but if you ever need to talk I can be a sounding board and can help you locate resources if you need anything. Hope you're doing well.""I choose a presentation on the song ""Jeremy"" by _PERSON_ for Adolescent psychology presentation.  If you do not know what it is about, a 16-year-old boy committed suicide in front of his classmates.  This song is powerful and chilling at the same time and that is why I chose it; also felt appropriate for the class because many adolescents deal with suicidal thoughts...including me.A little back story about my suicidal thoughts...they started to arise in my junior year in high school, so around the age of 16 or 17.  I am currently 19 and I am a sophomore in college.  The thoughts started to appear one day when I was feeling depressed over school work and I'm pretty sure a crush that just broke my heart.  I thought nothing of this because 1.) I don't have the guts to kill myself and 2.) I thought every teenager experienced these thoughts.  I have cut myself numerous times when I was in high school, but no one knew about them because they were on my leg.Also, a bit about my personality: I am very easy-going on the outside.  I am always willing to listen to people and I probably would describe myself as a ""wallflower"".  I have never had parent issues and they are really supportive of me and my way of life.  I have a decent amount of friends and I usually have normal college conversations with them.  I have one really close friend that we can share anything, but I haven't had the courage to tell her about my suicidal thoughts.  I also have a girlfriend, but we have only been dating a few weeks so I can't really open up too much with her.  She also parties a little bit; I don't at all and have never had the interest in drinking.Fast-forward to now and I have started to think about suicide all over again.  The end of my freshman year was when they came back because my girlfriend of a year and some months told me she didn't love me anymore.  I started to write poems about this and how I just wish everything would come to an end (I also wrote poems in my junior and senior years of high school with suicidal thoughts).  They really started to progress this year, my sophomore year, when I would be driving and would hope that a car or train (I go to college by a major railroad) would hit me and just end it.  They have been off and on for about two months now, but again they are just thoughts.The medicine that my professor was talking about was Celexa because I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.  The first week I was on it, the thoughts completely stopped, but I was ungodly tired.  It has been two weeks and the thoughts of suicide are coming back.  They haven't been extremely strong thoughts, but I have picked up my entire pill bottle once and thought about just ending it all.  All in all, Celexa hasn't increased my thoughts about suicide and I believe it has stopped some of my self-diagnosed depression.Any advice for me to help controlling these thoughts?  I really don't want them anymore and I want to control them before they start to take over me.",0,10,682,direct quoted email enjoyed presentation today interesting thought received wanted check things song topic made worry bit hope relating jeremy mentioned class medication wanted follow counselor clinician talk sounding board locate resources hope choose presentation song jeremy person adolescent psychology presentation year boy committed suicide front classmates song powerful chilling time chose felt class adolescents deal suicidal thoughts including back story suicidal thoughts started arise junior year high school age sophomore college thoughts started day feeling depressed school work pretty crush broke heart thought guts kill thought teenager experienced thoughts cut numerous times high school knew leg bit personality easy listen people describe wallflower parent issues supportive life decent amount friends normal college conversations close friend share courage suicidal thoughts girlfriend dating weeks open parties bit interest drinking fast forward started suicide end freshman year back girlfriend year months told love anymore started write poems end wrote poems junior senior years high school suicidal thoughts started progress year sophomore year driving hope car train college major railroad hit end months thoughts medicine professor talking celexa diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder week thoughts completely stopped ungodly tired weeks thoughts suicide coming back extremely strong thoughts picked entire pill bottle thought ending celexa increased thoughts suicide stopped diagnosed depression advice controlling thoughts anymore control start,28.0,21.0,13,19,7,16,12,16,5,20

563,"I'm not sure if i can post here asking how i can help one of my friends, but... w/e.So theres is this friend of mine (a girl) who i found out is suicidal. Her thing is this: When she was 15, she enjoyed getting her ear's pierced and started becoming obsessed with them. Not for the sole reason of piercings or the act of getting them, but because she asked her mom for an additional piercing on her ear lobe, and her mother said she was allowed if she lost 10 lbs. To this girl, she took it that her mother was discreetly implying that she was unworthy of any reward because of her weight (she's not fat, obese or extremely thin or anything like that. As of now, i believe she said she was 110lbs, which ironically is my weight -_- .). Thats how she developed anorexia. I never saw her in school for a semester/term, because she was in the hospital for treatment. She got back for 2nd semester, and thank god she did because i kind of like her and i didn't wanna see her do anything worse... *sigh.* Then i was recently texting her because she posted her Tumblr page on Twitter. i don't have an account, but i checked it out. Now iv'e been on the site before, so i know whats on it and all, but the fact that her's mainly consisted of suicidal/hurtful thoughts and pictures with captions made me think she was in some kind of suicidal state/though. I then text her asking of she was ok and whatnot and she's saying things like ""nothing will change"", ""i just wanna die i guess"", ""I have no friends"" and ""i feel like everybody hates me"". I was like this before, thinking about killing myself but not actually harming myself because I'm to big of a bitch to do it. However, upon asking, she said that she cuts ""a lot"". Now again, I ""like"" like this girl so of course i don't want her to do be doing that. I want to help her, and she has had help before, but i wont to be that person that makes sure she's happy and all. I know it's probably not my place to intervene and i should ""tell an adult"" but people did that with me before and it didn't help, it just caused more problems, so i don't want to put that on her.

569,"I've been feeling suicidal on/off now for a few weeks and I'm terrified of what I might do.For some background, I'm a trans woman, currently studying for my Masters in Plant Science, but lately, I feel like things have just been stacking up higher and higher and it seems like the only way out is suicide. I'm reasonably sure that that's depression talking, but it's just so hard to see any sort of good coming out of things in the future. It seems that like whenever things get rough, my default go-to response is to seriously consider killing myself, and I'm terrified that one day, I might actually end up going through with it.I've been trying to see a pysch with the university, but I learnt today, not even three hours way from my appointment that my psych was sick and that she'd have to reschedule. She's pretty much the only psych at the university that works with trans people, and she'll be going on vacation in about two weeks so I will probably only have the one session. If I think that she's not terrible, I'm considering seeing her at her private practice during the summer. I've also considered trying to see another psych here that does work over the summer, but given how the person I saw for my assessment when I first showed up as a result of feeling suicidal thought that referring to a trans guy as her friend's daughter was perfectly fine, even after a supposed sensitivity workshop with regards to trans issues, I'm more than a little dubious of the quality of the psychological care I'd receive from people who don't specialize in dealing with trans people.I've been finding that the university has been a pretty shitty environment. Part of this is due to the repeated incidents of not respecting their own preferred name (and from less than one week in my first term, an actualy legal name change that was also filed with the university) policies due to what seems to be incompetence and departments never speaking to one another. A well-documented complaint about this to the Dean of Students has yielded nothing to date, despite assurances that I would been contacted with results of the investigation within 2-3 months (it's been four and a half months). The actual work I'm supposed to be doing (since my productivity has been just about nil in the past two or three months) is shitty and painful (yay for manipulating metal at -20 to -25C for hours on end without being able to use anything more substantial than nitrile gloves to protect my hands), but maybe I just need to toughen up or something. A simple meeting with my supervisor or even just contemplating to go in to the lab in the morning to work has managed to leave me feeling shaky, nauseous, scared and contemplating killing myself on more than one occasion. I've heard from most people that graduate school is supposed to be tough and make you feel miserable, but it shouldn't be making you feel like you're actually going to kill yourself.When I tried going to see a counselor about when I first started feeling suicidal (maybe a month ago or something? I don't remember exactly), I basically got a tough love sort of approach to things that basically summed up to ""Life sucks and shit's unlikely to get better, you're going to have to learn to find the less shitty bits and have those carry you through the rest of the time"", which I found to be pretty unhelpful.Other than this, however, life is pretty nice, but it just feels like it doesn't matter, and that every once in a while, especially around times of high stress, my brain will just go back into seriously considering suicide, including methods of doing so.I'm not even sure what this post is about at this point, and I don't know if I want advice, compassion or even just to be able to rant/bitch/moan about things, but I figured that this would be a good place to go.",0,6,682,feeling suicidal weeks terrified background trans woman studying masters plant science feel things stacking higher higher suicide depression talking hard sort good coming things future things rough default response killing terrified day end ve pysch university learnt today hours appointment psych sick reschedule pretty psych university works trans people vacation weeks session terrible private practice summer considered psych work summer person assessment showed result feeling suicidal thought referring trans guy friend daughter perfectly fine supposed sensitivity workshop trans issues dubious quality psychological care receive people specialize dealing trans people ve finding university pretty shitty environment part due repeated incidents respecting preferred week term actualy legal change filed university policies due incompetence departments speaking documented complaint dean students yielded date assurances contacted results investigation months half months actual work supposed productivity nil past months shitty painful yay manipulating metal hours end substantial nitrile gloves protect hands toughen simple meeting supervisor contemplating lab morning work managed leave feeling shaky nauseous scared contemplating killing occasion heard people graduate school supposed tough make feel miserable making feel kill counselor started feeling suicidal month ago remember basically tough love sort approach things basically summed life sucks shit learn find shitty bits carry rest time found pretty unhelpful life pretty nice feels matter times high stress brain back suicide including methods post point advice compassion rant bitch moan things figured good place,30.0,29.0,18,21,15,21,15,24,8,19

They wouldn't have to deal with my stupidity and lack of ability to make good choices. They basically don't want me around to begin with. I needed a place to live and they wouldn't help me.

He could be with some one that makes him happy but instead he's with me and I'm a constant anxiety full buzz kill.

I know now I have anxiety and I am constantly anxious about something and I know half the time it's something so little that I shouldn't even be worried about or that shouldn't cause me anxiety but it does.

I posted an online add tonight to get rid of my dogs. I'm currently living at my boyfriends family home while he is finishing school and I finish my first year of my undergrad. School feels pretty much pointless right now since it takes all kinds of money and I'm probably going to come out of it with nothing anyways. So again, why do I need to exist?

578,"I'm bipolar. Had a bit of a freak out tonight. I found out through a third-party than one of my roommates is planning on moving out in less than a month. I am so fucked for money right now it's not even funny. I've even had someone in r/loans lend me $70. It's still not enough. Not nearly enough. I know that finding out about sudden changes can set off an episode, but my stupid roommate hasn't even had the decency to tell this to me face to face. He's a goddamn coward. I got so angry I started yelling to no one really. Just saying, ""I knew he was a goddamn prick,"" and ""what a fucking asshole!"" At which point my boyfriend flew into a rage and started defending HIM. I got so angry at him I scratched him pretty bad. After I calmed down we ""talked through it,"" but talking through it with my boyfriend always means arguing until I get tired and then give up and start agreeing with him. And this is all after we had a long heart-to-heart over dinner last night over what we can do to improve our relationship. Things have been shaky here and there but otherwise strong. I know I'm totally boyfriend bashing now, but I'm still upset. GOD, even though I just want to go straight to the bathroom and down all the pills in there. I have plenty of muscle relaxants, anti-depressents, vicodin and generic shit in there to get the job done. I WANT SOMEONE TO JUST TAKE SOME PITY ON ME! Is that so wrong? Does that make me an attention-getting whore? Nobody's kind words will do anything at this point. Only money is going to help me get out of the mire that I'm in. I've been to the hospital THREE TIMES now within the course of one month!! ONE FUCKING MONTH. I barely make minimum wage as it is.

AND MY FUCKING FINANCIAL AID DOESN'T EVEN COVER THE COST OF SCHOOL. Every term they tell me, ""well you still owe us XXX amount of money,"" and then I still have to buy books and supplies! All of this because I'm under 25 years old and my parents make a lot of money. Well it just LOOKS like my parents make a lot of money, my dad lost his job and they're strapped for cash now too! They can't afford to help me out or take a Parent Plus Loan. I'm so fucking tired of pursuing every single fucking avenue and being defeated in the end. Please. No one offer me money. I won't be able to pay it back.Nobody offer kind words, because I'm just going to fucking end it.Please, nobody tell me that 25 is too young to know my life is going to suck forever.

Now it's a bit better for a month or two, for two weeks now I am doing sport, went to /r/NoFap as it might partially have been part of the problem, and I am working out a small habit at a time my way out (I am reading ""the Slight Edge"" I would recommend to anyone, wonderful book.)What brought me here is the fact that I have relapses. Yesterday for instance, I argued with my wife yesterday, ended leaving the house to a 10 min walk (very rare). It was short, and we solved it the same evening, but during the 10 minute walk, the dark thoughts came back to me, and the will to kill myself came back.My main question and problem I would like to solve, is how do you get rid of these thoughts? How to do get back to being a normal person, who can be upset but without going deep to the end of everything.Looking for advice, maybe materials, tips, experience.",1,9,295,quick intro father entrepreneur married thought post month realised suicidal thought coming regular basis points managed plan details finish source problems lost marriage year terrible time business problem managing day social anxiety lack confidence started fired job years ngo life started crash mid solving urgent problems restoring kind intimacy couple reconnected kids deep fear regular mood problems bit month weeks sport nofap partially part problem working small habit time reading slight edge recommend wonderful book brought fact relapses yesterday instance argued wife yesterday ended leaving house min walk rare short solved evening minute walk dark thoughts back kill back main question problem solve rid thoughts back normal person upset deep end advice materials tips experience,11.0,14.0,5,9,2,11,4,11,3,8

Even though I'm 21, I'm severely mentally ill and live at home with no job or school anymore and I am under their insurance. I called the CSB down the street earlier for advice on how to go about getting admitted and the lady on call was extremely rude, saying that if I haven't made an active attempt, I can't be considered for our city's inpatient programs (which isn't true, I've been inpatient several times). I do not have access to money, a car, or even any friends with cars who could assist in taking me to the ER. My parents have dealt with my illnesses for years and I'm grossly undermedicated and poorly treated with the disorders I have. I was taken off of several medications including a strong antipsychotic in January and a prescribed, non-abused benzo and a mood stabilizer in February, and things have been all downhill from there. I'm marked down as a drug abuser with manipulative behavior. I've been thinking and wanting to commit suicide since the day after I left the hospital in March for the fourth time. I attempted three days later but was never taken in and everyone talks about it being a ""stunt"". Thankfully my therapist is great, so I'm calling her in the morning to see if she can't talk some sense into my parents and make them take me into the ER, which they have said several times they will not do anymore. I've packed a bag and gotten numbers together for my proposed trip to the psych ward for a few weeks. I've been there, my old psychiatrist works there still and he's great but my parents hate him for medicating me. Anyways, I'm at the end of my rope. I have two options. Do everything I can to get my parents to take me in and, for christ's sake, let me get the help I need without injecting their horribly ignorant and ill-informed opinions. I have a note written up and a fool-proof plan. I don't want to do it. The voices want me to. I have to. That's my purpose. Nobody, including my parents, my psychiatrist, and the community services board that I called tonight believes that I could really be that bad off. I started cutting again the other day and was screamed at for it, and persuaded to start smoking again instead of cutting. My parents believe that I do not want to actively get better and I am wasting valuable time and money that could be better spent on other things. Oh and to top it off, I was supposed to move across the country this week to live with my ex who was going to provide a stable home for me away from my parents. I fucked that up. I fuck everything up. I'm fucked up. I am trapped. And I will either fight my way out of this hole, or I will kill myself in it. There is no third option.

606,"*For the record, I am not suicidal or depressed whatsoever, just wanted to ask a question.*Bascially, my father was a royally fucked-up person. He was often in-and-out of jail, completely poor, homeless, likely a pedophile, and an alcoholic. An extremely bad alcoholic. I saw him every so often, but I was never really *that* attached to him. I live(d) with my mother, step-dad, and some siblings. He wasn't really a part of anything. So a few years back, when I was 12, he went out to the desert in Arizona and killed himself. When I heard the news I cried about as hard as I would if I scraped my knee. Nothing really changed. After this happened, my mother noticed something about me; I was a lot like my father. I took up playing guitar (which I found out later was one of his favorite things), and started listening to music (which, coincidentally I ended up liking the same bands as he did, without even knowing it. Turns out we both really like the Rolling Stones). I inherited some physical attributes similar to his as well, such as my hair type and whatnot. This made me nervous about two things: alcohol and suicide. I've already decided that alcohol is never, ever going to be a part of my life. Not to say I'll never drink, but I've read that alcoholism can be genetic, and I want to avoid that road as much as possible. This brings me to the other thing: suicide.Now, my father was obviously quite depressed. He probably drank to cover his depression. Now, my mother is also quite depressed, but she's on antidepressants and she doesn't drink or anything. That means I have depression on both sides of my family.I just want to know if these things put me at an increased risk of depression, suicidal tendencies, etc. I know there's not much to do about it if it does, but I still wanna know. **tl;dr: dad killed himself and I'm lots like my dad.

My mother has always been physically (hitting me) and emotionally abusive to me (especially when I was in middle school) and she's told me several times that I'm the devil. She tells me with confidence and not a care in the world, that I am going to hell. I'm closer to my dad and I've told him some of this, but I know he thinks I'm overreacting and he always sides with her.

I'm always trying to save my friends from cutting themselves and suicide, by calling them and always being there for them even at 3 in the morning. My own struggles are deteriorating me too, though.

621,"One of my earliest memories was trying to drown. Supposedly carefree days of childhood were plagued with crushing depression that hasn't let up even into adulthood. I had thought about suicide so much that I feel desensitized to it.  I've tried OD'ing on sleeping pills, and hanging.  When I was in the ER after the sleeping pills, my parents told me that I should have shot myself like a man.I grew up without friends, barely have any now, feel terribly alone all the time even in crowded places. I regret my major choice and while I taught overseas, despite being good at it, I don't have any passion in teaching.  I've been back in the states for a few months trying to get better to no avail.  My savings from teaching are almost gone and I still have no idea what to do with my life.Transitioning to female and being published were two of my life goals, but I still feel miserable and like a failure. My fiance broke up with me the day after christmas.  Even those who said they'd stick by me always  can't deal with my depression.  I've tried therapists, medicine, group counseling, but still feel so hopeless and empty.  I feel as if I were broken.  Born too early, was going blind, mute, never smiling as a child and I moved around so much.  I remember sitting by myself during recess wondering why I couldn't be normal like the other kids.  Being transgender on top of that just made the bullying worse, was even tied up and locked in a closet by daycare staff when I was 6 for playing with dolls.Sometimes I feel like I'm a specter in others' lives, barely noticed and not making any difference in this world. There are times when I should be feeling happy, but I just feel like crying.  I feel terribly alone. My family still don't accept me.  I've lost interest in my passions or don't have access to them like having a pet or a piano to play.  Everything just feels so empty. I have lost appetite a year ago and even dropped from just being underweight to almost severe anorexia.  I've heard deep depression is when it lasts 2 years, but what about 31 years?So here I am posting to strangers for help, because I have no one in my life to turn to. After surviving attempts I have, I figured the bridge was the surefire way. Oddly enough, having it as an option has helped me in the past but the net project is moving forward so my time is short.

I had a recent breakup with the woman I love (I'm a girl by the way).  She thinks we need time apart.... a year of no talking if we will ever talk again.  I had to give away my dog, the closest thing to family that I have. My friend of ten years decided to no longer be my friend for a few months to teach me patience.  I lost my position at a suicide hotline due to being under stress despite being really good at it.  It was the one thing that gave me purpose in life.  Hearing others say I saved their life helped me to continue living despite dealing with chronic suicidality myself.

In an incredibly dark place right now, from the UK and been up most of the night - can't remember the last time I slept more than 4 hours.Ok so started on some new anti-depressants a few weeks ago and thought they were working. Last week I felt a bit like my old self, like the depression was starting to lift. Then I woke up friday morning and felt like I'd hit absolute rock bottom - haven't left this dark place ever since.Tried to kill myself yesterday and now my family know the true extent of my depression - brought embarrassment onto myself and my family. Came home to my boyfriend - well, now ex - having packed up all my things and asking me to move out. Absolutely devastated. Do you think after some time and space he would consider talking to me again? Anyone had similar experiences? I just want to call him and it's so hard not to but I know I shouldn't (and I won't). To be honest the main reason I didn't go through with suicide yesterday is because I know he would feel guilty for not being able to stop me and I couldn't leave this world knowing he felt like that. :'(Now living at my mums again and she's scared to leave me on my own. But I just want to be left alone and feel shitty, nothing can or is ever going to help. Off to see some pychologist in a few hours which terrifies me.

626,"Ok apologies in advance for this message, it's pretty much just a huge rant.Where to start? Tough upbringing of parents who were constantly on/off until they finally got divorced last year. During my teenage years they both hit me many times, ended up with bruises and broken bones, particularly from my mum. I have forgiven them now but it has shaped me into a person I do not like. I have suffered from depression for a while, officially diagnosed in January after trying to commit suicide, I feel like I can't go on anymore.I'm a 20 year old female, I like to think I'm a nice person. Would literally do anything for anyone. For the past 3 years I have been training to be a nurse. I love the job but due to certain events I'm having to give it up (read below).Ok so Saturday I got into a huge argument with my (ex) boyfriend of 2 1/2 years. We had been dodgy for a while but I fucked up hugely. I lost my temper and hit out at him, more than once. It was like I had no control - that isn't an excuse but I just felt like I saw red and the second it clicked in my head what had happened I stopped immediately and since then I have been disgusted in myself. It's like what my parents used to do with me and I've learnt their awful behaviour. I know I have probably ruined things for good but I really just can't see myself moving forward. I love him beyond believe and am hurting so much. I'm so ashamed in my behaviour and I understand why he would never want me back but I would literally do anything to be with him. I believe, for many reasons, he is the one and I don't want anyone else. He makes me so happy and I'm just a huge screw up.Then the shittest news of all. On Monday I was diagnosed with bowel cancer. After much deliberation I have decided to no go ahead with treatment. It feels like I'm genuinely just never meant to be happy. I can't go through the pain of treatment as well as heartache at the same time. I was meant to have an operation today but cancelled it because I don't feel the money should be spent on me (I'm from the UK, NHS should spend their money on somebody more worthwhile). I have made a bucket list and want to tick off some things then kill myself before I get too ill to do it.

I've lived a life full of great deeds yet I feel like there is nothing that is more sinster and more hurtful than what I am about to say.I can't feel that I can love anything because I have been stricken with a disease that is uncurable that no one knows what the source of the problem is.

I am obsessed with being liked by others because I've been rejected by so many who have just brushed me off because I'm too sporadic or too plain. I just cannot learn how to be better at being social as much as I try.

631,"I'd just like to get all this down somewhere and hopefully organize my thoughts along the way. Hello, by the way. In advance, thanks for reading. I'm 25 now. Male. I'll preface this by saying that I've had a lot of mental issues ever since I can remember, but I won't get too much into that just for the sake of time. I have depression, ocd, social anxiety, trichotillomania, I might be bipolar? and I might also be a compulsive liar. I don't know. After I graduated from college with a _PERSON_'s degree in Culinary Arts / Nutrition I was almost immediately hired into a culinary management training program for a large, successful hotel company. As I lived in New York at the time at my family home, I had to move out to one of their properties in California if I wanted to take the job. Of course I leapt at the offer! Fast forward a little bit, I've moved out there to CA, started my job and had my own apartment, am paying my bills/college loans. I leased a new car. I made enough money that I could throw it around a little, within reason. But I was overall pretty comfortable. I lived about 1 mile from a popular beach in a community with a good night life, selection of restaurants/shops and easy access to the highway. After a year of living there I get pretty tired of my job. The hours are long, I work 60+ hours a week and sometimes work up to 10 days at a pace with no break in-between. I've worked in the culinary industry before and am no stranger to this, but I'm just not that passionate about the field anymore and want to do something else. Something less stressful with less hours, more of a stable lifestyle. I don't have the aspirations to be a great, famous chef.But the problem was that they really liked me at the company. When I was there I worked hard, was passionate about the food that I made and my chefs and co-workers noticed this. Towards the end of my time there, the chefs wanted to make me a sous-chef (pretty big deal for someone like me right out of school). And here I am, who doesn't want it. Other people would jump at the opportunity, would give so much just to have ANY job.I lived in California and worked at the hotel for nearly 2 years before I made the decision to move back home to New York. I wanted to move back home to NY to be closer to my friends/family. I wanted to explore a new job and hopefully make a career change. I wanted to live in New England.Toward the end of my time in Cali I was thinking about killing myself nearly everyday, and in fact one day I wrote a letter to my family and came very close to acting on it. I have had serious thoughts on suicide for many years now, but they wax and wane. When I was in my adolescence I was put in the hospital for an otc drug overdose, a botched suicide attempt. Well, I ended up quitting and moving home last October. I packed all my crap up and drove back to NY and moved back in with my parents in their apartment. Since then I've been looking for a job, trying to figure out what the fuck I want to do with my life and just can't seem to think of anything that I'm really that interested in doing. I'm at my wits end and I just don't want to try anymore. I owe a lot of student loans for a degree that I'm not all that interested in. The urge to commit suicide has been so strong. I know now that I won't do anything beneficial to the rest of the world. I'm just a leech. I don't go outside anymore, I just sit in my room with the shades drawn and browse the internet for jobs or bullshit &amp; play games. Generally, I don't go outside for days at a time. The friends that I thought I had here in NY aren't really there for me. I've been having issues with my fiance too, but that could be a whole other post in itself. She's been fucking this other guy and spending a lot of time with him. We're in an ""open"" relationship, but so far it's just been her spending time with other guys and me spending time with ... myself.I really, really, really should have stayed where I was. I had it so good there, and I threw it all the fuck away... and for what?I'm not sure if I can continue writing this, there's a lot of thoughts in my head screaming for attention and I can't seem to write them down in an orderly manner anymore.

632,"Before I get into things, I just wanted to preemptively thank you for sharing your time with me. I'm sorry we couldn't meet under better circumstances.It's hard to know where to begin. I've had a long and ugly history with suicide and self harm. It first became apparent in my teens, and came to a head when I landed myself in an overnight hospital stay for attempting to OD on prescription pills. Since that particular occasion about 10 years ago, I haven't had another ""serious"" attempt, although the suicidal thoughts have been ever present and plans have been thought through. A couple weeks ago I again tried to kill myself. Only my best friend knows about this attempt. Without getting into details, the method was carbon monoxide. It  would have been so perfect if that attempt were to have worked. I was ready. I drove about 8 hours from home to the place where I had thought to attempt the deed. My parents thought I was going to a job interview a few states away and wouldn't be home for a few days. I wrote out my notes to my loved ones, I spent the entire day in reflection in a naturally beautiful and peaceful place that I've loved since I was a boy, and by the end of the day when I started my preparations I was calm and at ease. Ready for the next step, ready to finally rest. Suffice it to say, here I am, still talking to you now. I've felt for a long time that I will eventually end my own life someday. It could be this year, the next, or perhaps 10-20 years down the road. Matters in my life have been taking a tailspin for years, and it's only a matter of time until I well up the courage again to make another determined action. Perhaps the worst part about it is that many people have a worse life than I do. I take so much for granted. A family that loves and supports me both mentally and economically while I'm unemployed. I'm in good physical health. I have a close friend who listens to me ­­constantly talk about my retinue of problems, and has never once complained. I was fortunate enough to go to college, and I have nice things like a computer and a smart phone. So many things I have that others do not, and it makes me feel so goddamn guilty for not appreciating them. I know what I *should* do. I should dust myself off and try my best to pick up the scattered pieces of my life. If not for myself, then for my parents whom have given so much up for my sibling and I over the years. But I find myself totally inable. Some days I actually do try to engage in positive activities to break free from this horrible vicious cycle, however it seems that they always seem to blow up in my face. I've all but given up trying to find a job- it's been nearly two years since I've been gainfully employed. My GF of about a year left. The majority of my friends have all moved away or just don't have time for me anymore, neither of which is their fault. I have insomnia and can't sleep more than 4 hours or so at a clip, yet I still stay in bed most of the day and read or netflix; anything to escape from the reality of my situation. You know, I do wish that things would get better. I want a job, I want friends to go out and have fun with, I want a romantic relationship that finally works.

633,"Hey. I just need to get my thoughts down (again), and I'm sorry if the prose is slightly scatter-brained. I apologize if you're sick of hearing from me by now; I couldn't blame you. There are plenty of other lost souls on this subreddit who deserve the attention much more.I think I'm going to attempt to kill myself within the next few days. I'll be using the same method I tried about a month ago- carbon monoxide -and hopefully it will be more successful this time. I'm just not sure of where exactly I'm going to do it, and a few other logistics. I drove 8 hours through a handful of states for the last attempt (and another 8 hours back home directly after the failed attempt), and I just don't have another long drive in me, especially if I fail again.No one knows about the last attempt but for my best friend, whom I had confessed to after the fact, and you guys. I've wrestled with many mental issues throughout more than half my life, and I'm just so done. Before you ask- I'm not seeing a therapist, I'm not professionally diagnosed by a doctor or taking any medications to deal with my problems. I exercise every couple days, which is about all I do to try to better myself. I know those are all paths I need to follow, or face the consequences and die prematurely. Some compassionate redditors reading this subreddit have suggested those things and more to me in the past. But I just cannot bring myself to do it. I just want the pain to stop, I want my horrible thoughts finally quelled, I want to say my goodbyes to the world that I know and just *sleep*. I know this inaction to try to fix my problems makes me undeserving of the life I have, especially when considering how many utterly innocent people there are out there in the world who endure untold suffering due to war, unchecked disease, extreme poverty and famine. Many of these people will die young and never get even a glimpse at the life that I'm afforded with modern luxuries such as a secure house with electricity and plumbing, medicine and an organized government. It's all relative though. But despite all that.. I just can't do it anymore- deep in my heart I've given up.

634,"Hello. It turns out I'm a serial poster here. My girlfriend of about a year and I broke up last April. I've been pretty fucked up since then. The day after we broke up I blew off a job interview I had that day and tried to kill myself with carbon monoxide (not simply a suicide ""gesture"", explained more completely in an older post here). She doesn't know about it. It wasn't just because of our breakup- I have a lot of other things going on in my life which contribute toward the feelings. Since that failed attempt I've had my highs and lows, although my highs were not particularly high and my lows have reached greater and greater depths as time drags on. I think of suicide c-o-n-s-t-a-n-t-l-y.We hadn't texted or chatted on Facebook since June 12th, which is a long time for me. I foolishly broke the law of No Contact tonight by trying to call her up. She didn't answer, as usual, nor did I receive any text. I will probably get one tomorrow morning when she's on her way to work. It will wake me up and I won't be able to fall back asleep again. She'll say she's sorry she couldn't pick up because she was out with friends, or she had an early night. Things she usually says when she doesn't answer. Perhaps she was fucking a new boyfriend. Who knows.I don't know what I expected or wanted- I suppose simply to hear her voice again. I haven't heard her voice since January. When she left it was as if my arm was cut off, she was a part of me. The best part of me. Now that we arent talking anymore I've lost my best friend, my lover.

637,"Hi,I'm hesitant to post this, as I have friends and family who know my username, but I have to get it out. Prior to about 2 weeks ago, I had never had a suicidal though. It came out of nowhere, and I can't figure out why it's happening. I'm 23Long story short, I graduated back in college with an engineering degree, and went straight into a corporate job. At first, I was really happy. College was very stressful for me, and corporate life is comparatively much easier. That said, my job isn't stimulating at all. A lot of times, I sit at my desk for 8 hours reading reddit and watching youtube. I can only work from home when I'm sick or can't otherwise make it to the office. I almost never have enough work to fill 40 hours a week. I look forward to leaving at the end of the day and coming home to my roommates. For my age group, I make excellent moneyHowever, the last two weeks or so, I haven't found any joy outside of work either. My routine is getting stale, and I'm not finding anything that can replace that routine, and I'm sorta stuck in a rut. I used to love video games. Now I don't, and I'm finding myself doing more or less nothing for hours after I come home. I might read for an hour, watch netflix for an hour, etc. Then I go to bed, wake up the next morning, and do it all over again. Then comes the weekend. Friday night/saturday morning are about the only time I'm reasonably happy. I might go out with a friend, see a movie, sleep in a bit. By about noon, I'm bored again, and the rest of the weekend is a slog.Now, part of it is that last summer I was rock climbing a ton, which I find very rewarding. Unfortunately, it hasn't been warm enough to climb recently. I'm seriously hoping I'm just going stir crazy. But then I start thinking about it, and I'm like ""I don't even feel like going right now"".So yeah, I'm starting to get the feeling that the things in my life that I used to find meaningful aren't meaningful anymore, and it scares the crap out of me. If I can't find meaning in my life, why live? At first, that thought was fleeting, but today while I was bored to death at work, that thought started to consume me. And it hasn't really left since. What the heck is the point of living if none of it is meaningful? If I'm just going to have 80 more years of nothing meaningful, then I have no desire to keep living. To put it succinctly, if every week is like the past couple weeks have been, I don't want to live. Objectively, the past two weeks haven't even been bad. And that scares the shit out of me.Please don't say ""wow must be nice to have your life"". I absolutely agree with you. I have a great family, relatively good job, a nice car, an apartment with roommates, and all I can think about is how bored I am all the time. And for whatever reason, my scumbag brain can't get rid of the idea that ""suicide will fix it!"". I'm just not finding joy in anything over the past few weeks. Not the gym, not rock climbing, not hockey, especially not work, not video games, you get the idea. Please help me. I don't want to end it all, but I'm feeling like that's the only way out.",0,12,602,hesitant post friends family username prior weeks ago suicidal figure happening long story short graduated back college engineering degree straight corporate job happy college stressful corporate life comparatively easier job stimulating lot times sit desk hours reading reddit watching youtube work home sick make office work fill hours week forward leaving end day coming home roommates age group make excellent moneyhowever weeks found joy work routine stale finding replace routine sorta stuck rut love video games don finding hours home read hour watch netflix hour bed wake morning weekend friday night saturday morning time happy friend movie sleep bit noon bored rest weekend slog part summer rock climbing ton find rewarding warm climb recently hoping stir crazy start thinking feel yeah starting feeling things life find meaningful meaningful anymore scares crap find meaning life live thought fleeting today bored death work thought started consume left heck point living meaningful years meaningful desire living put succinctly week past couple weeks live objectively past weeks bad scares shit wow nice life absolutely agree great family good job nice car apartment roommates bored time reason scumbag brain rid idea suicide fix finding joy past weeks gym rock climbing hockey work video games idea end feeling,24.0,11.0,8,13,8,8,11,8,4,11

641,"My story started the 4th of January 2013. It hasn't been going great for a long, long time (~2-3 years) and I knew I was strugging. My girlfriend at the time, _PERSON_, knew I was struggling as well. I broke up with her 2 days prior to this as I just no longer saw a future. I did not have any feelings left and felt empty. I couldn't sleep for the longest time until it hit me: ''It was me, I was the person that had a problem''In a moment of panic and realisation what I had done, I called my _PERSON_ awake and went over to her place. In tears, panic I spilled my story as best as I could for that moment and begged her to come back to me. We decided we would give it another shot and I would go look for help. I managed to find help, someone to talk to. Every week we had meetings and talked about things, but it didn't feel like I was hitting the core of my issues. We then decided I would go to another psychologist she advised me who specliased in 'System therapy'. Not knowing what I would get myself into, I accepted and went there. It didn't take him very long to crack me. I can safely say I experienced the worst pain, agony and grief that I had ever felt within 15 minutes of walking in there. To cut a long story a bit shorter there: I have a deceased brother who died at the age of 6 months. He died years before I would be born, but the long lasting effects of such tragedy... My parents never managed to deal with it and being the next boy to be born, I carried the burden. I was not only being myself, I was also my older brother. I acted, cared, protected as if I were 2 persons. I was literally keeping the family together. My sisters each had their own boatload of trouble during their puberty, my father eventually broke down and spent 3 months internally to get mental help. My mother, well she never managed to get over the loss of her first son. Finally after more then 9 months after the 4th of January I managed to finally start working on getting a healthy relationship with my mother. This basically boiled down to me not being allowed to listen to her problems. I was no longer allowed to be the person in her life, my dad had to re-invent that. Out of all the things that happened, out of all the things that managed to change in that period.. this was the only thing I think lasted. I literally care for people, I protect people, I listen to endless amounts of stories/problems from people because that is what I learned to do. I learned to listen, take it all up and then tell people it would get better. Hell, I learned how to give advice and perhaps that caused more people to empty their hearts to me. In the end, I simply cannot give anymore. I'm tired.. just so tired. Even after completing all those sessions, learning things about how people work, learning about how I work.. I was just exhausted. I could no longer give, care or anything. I eventually broke up with _PERSON_ after all the hell we've been through. It was harsh, it was 1-sided and at the time seemed like the best thing to do. I simply did not have the energy to be in this relationship. We were perfect for eachother. I was raised to care for people, she lost her father at an early age and was looking for a father figure. It was perfect, but unhealthy. I had to get out even though she is the person that I want to marry.We are now, what, 9 months later and things were going for the worse. It went really good for some time, I managed to pick up my study (economics teacher), I managed to get some energy back and everything seemed fine, but things happened and it changed me. First off was _PERSON_. A lovely girl, a few years older. She has a relationship, but was looking for some adventure. At first I thought I was doing something right, but after making out several weeks outside her apartment, I started to realise what was happening. I wasn't seducing this girl, I was her escape from her misserable relationship. Voilá, 3 weeks later her friend had chirgury to reduce the headaches, has recovered from that and is feeling great again. Guess what way the attention went? I'll save you the details on other things that happen, but one thing never changed. Plenty of people wanted my attention. Plenty of people wanted to speak out their problems, they wanted someone that listens to them and helps them get through it. Still, knowing what happens.. I cannot resist. It's who I am or at least who I think I am.Over the weeks that came after, I just started slipping. I know what is happening to me. I know exactly what is happening. I'm having a full-blown fallback. That exact feeling is coming back to me and it's terrifying, but it's different. Previously I was just afraid, I was scared, I was angry and I didn't understand. This time however, I do understand. I am full aware of what is happening to me and I think I stopped caring. Last saturday, I went out with several people and it was a fun night, plenty happened with the people I was out with but .. I just snapped. Something in my mind said.. fuck this. I have been scared, angry and all those things, but now I just don't believe it will improve. I emptied my heart to a friend of mine and she basically said: ''no, you are not going to end yourself, I will not allow it'' and that did great things to me. It did me great, I felt new energy for a few hours, it didn't last long.What followed were the worst days of fear I had ever lived. I am afraid when I wake up, I am afraid to go to bed. If I don't hypnotize myself with some dumb game or activity I can only think about how mad I am, how sad I am, how I don't believe in any person willing to help me. I fantasise about walking across the high-way, I want to feel what it is like to have my life hanging in the palm of my end. I embrace the feeling of ending it. I refuse to, I 'm not going to I think, but these thoughts have been the warmest thoughts I have had in a long time. It is as death is the person I love and cherish. It's like something is welcoming me to release of all this pain, this grief, this never changing cycle. But you know, I still had people out there. I still had a few people that I trust, that if I were to be in real pain or trouble I could talk to. So I texted _PERSON_. The one person, above everyone else, that I trust. She promised me, when we broke up, that if there was EVER a problem or something like this that she would be there. She made me promise to tell her and she'd be there. Out of all the people in the world, if I was about to kill myself, _PERSON_ was the one I should call. And she just didn't respond. She saw my messages, she knows very well what is happening to me.. and she doesn't care enough to listen. 8 days from now, I turn 25. I live in a world that does not care about the people around them. If there is any chance of them not having to listen to others, they will take it. They will opt out because they are unable to listen. I live in a world where a person will not return the favor that you did oh so very often for them. I live in a world that would rather say at the funeral ''why didn't we listen to him'' then to actually pay attention to what is happening. Not to long ago, I read: &gt; Some people are already death, they just don't know it yet. I am not going to commit suicide, I died the 4th of January 2013.

644,"I've struggled off and on with depression for the last decade but I always felt secure that suicide was never going to enter the equation. I had this worldview that prevented those thoughts from ever coming up.But, for the first time ever, I feel as though it might be a good time to leave this world. There's a lot of reasons why, but what it all comes down to is that I'm tired. Really tired. Tired of searching for solutions, tired to struggling, tired of trying.I was going to see about getting student loans and going to get an engineering certificate so I could earn more than $10 an hour at a part-time retail job, but I don't care anymore. So what if I did? I could never work full-time. I'm working 30 hours now and when I come home every day I'm so exhausted I can barely speak coherently. All I do is come home, feed the animals and then go to bed again. 40+ hours a week is not something I could ever do.I thought about pursuing another dream of mine, but by the time I get the money to do it, I'll be too old to enroll. The dream is to try out the temporary monastic ordination program at a Buddhist abbey in Canada. There's an age cut-off. By the time I save up for it, I'm sure I'd be beyond that limit.I have a lot of other things I'd like to do and see, nothing really crazy, but I know I'll never earn enough money to do so. I'll never earn enough to even get my teeth fixed.I know I should go see a doctor to get a referral to a psychologist and/or therapist and I've been down that road before but it didn't really lead anywhere. While I was receiving help, I felt great, but it never lasted. While I was talking to a therapist I would be light-hearted, insightful, optimistic; I would feel great. An hour later I'd feel good. An hour after that I'd feel okay. Later on I'd feel dull and by the end of the day I'd feel like shit again.But as soon as my next therapy session came around, I'd be all sunshine and positive attitude. I'd have all the answers, all the motivation, all the drive and passion in that one room talking to a stranger. Then I'd leave that room and it'd all evaporate like a dream. I sought help and I got it, but it was no good to me.I've thought about the people I'd hurt if I left. My mom would be devastated, I know. She has her first grandchild through my younger brother now, just a month old. I figured my niece would be a good way for my mom to sublimate her grief. New life to take the edge off the loss of mine. My best friend, who until six months ago was the man I was going to marry, would be hurt because I'm sure he would never see it coming. I don't want to hurt him, but I know him, he'll be fine. He'll move on and he'll continue to lead an enviable life full of friends and lovers and travel.I thought that I could go on living for all these people in my life; that I at least had the energy to do that, even if my life was small and meaningless. But I don't feel like I have the energy to do even that. I can't think of any other way to sustain myself while still addressing my emotional needs. I can't not work and still pay the bills and receive professional help and indulge in small joys here and there.I'm nearly 32 years old, don't have a license/car, work in retail, was kicked out of University and am in debt to Student Loans to the tune of $20K that I can't pay back. I've missed years of Income Tax refunds that I can't figure out how to file nor can I afford the help to get them done. Even if I could, I have a really bad memory. I put the tax return forms right next to my laptop so I would remember to do them, but despite that I just keep forgetting.I want to be able to make life at home with my best friend better, but I can never think of ways to help out around the house. I'll come home and he'll have done something to improve our lives that's simple and obvious and I hate that I can't think creatively like that. I just want to show him that I'm not neglectful, I really want to help ... I just don't know how.And all this struggle has really taken a lot out of me. Trying to get better has exhausted me and I don't feel like I have anything left. I've reached that point of being perfectly at peace with leaving this world. I'm at peace with the idea that I will completely cease to exist, no afterlife. It wouldn't even be rest because there'd be no *me* to do any resting. I'm okay with that.

652,"I'd actually like to mention that I don't think I'll kill myself. I don't think I'll actually do it.But I need to tell someone about what's going on. If you're reading this, you're doing a very kind service to me. Thank you.I just... feel so alien here. Everywhere. I've been to so many places and I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't know if it's something wrong with me, but I feel this incessant hostility against my very own existence. I don't know where it's coming from, if it's an actual thing or a figment of my imagination. But dammit, I just feel like I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for all the suffering to be over. All the hurt.When's it going to end? When? There's been so much crying and wondering and philosophizing and meditating. There have been some ups, they've been lovely, but it's come to the point where I just don't feel like I can trust happiness.Like for example, if someone says they're happy, I don't believe them. I just assume that they haven't looked very deep into themselves. Their happiness is conditional, like I know that if I burned down their house, they wouldn't be happy anymore.I want peace.  I just want to be peaceful. I've seen some examples of peaceful people. I know it's possible, but I haven't figured it out. I keep thinking that if I can just penetrate deep enough, penetrate my psyche all the way through, if I can find the absolute rock-bottom of my existence, then I can live there and be well, finally be well.I feel like an old man, I can almost feel like I've done *this* over and over and over. I feel ancient. And I feel so tired. So tired!! I just want to rest, guys! There's this song that I heard almost ten years ago, called 'Solitaire-Unraveling' by _PERSON_ head, and is perhaps one of my favourite songs ever. One of the choruses goes:&gt;Time ticks away,&gt;These last few moments,&gt;Is there anything left unsaid?&gt;&gt;I'm on a quest for atonement,&gt;Got to find peace of mind&gt;and a place to rest.That's it!! That's exactly it! That's exactly my whole life! Atonement! Full circle. Finishing. Completing. Wrapping up. No more new karma, right, just saying everything that needs to be said, doing everything that needs to be done. Let me just say all my apologies for all the hurt I've caused in my various incarnations on this planet.I don't have a job, guys! I don't make any money. I just... whenever I think about getting a job, or work or something... it just feels so small, so *tedious*! My girl makes some money and she shares it with me. We're living in my parent's home and they share their food with us. It's not great. And my parents are like, well, how are you going to make money, son?I just wish, wish, wish, that someone would just give me some money. An apartment and some food, is all I need. Just some space from this pressure. Just a room where I can sit and no one's trying to tell me that time is running out, that I'm getting old, that I should be doing something else with my life.I'm just caught in this bind - things are not okay as they are, and no decent option is making itself apparent to me. So what to do? I feel like I'm being squeezed out existence? I feel rootless. I feel like a ghost. If it weren't for the people who I know, I'm not even sure how I could tell if I even exist!Perhaps the largest reason why I'm remaining alive is because of how much trouble it would be for everyone who loves me if I were to die. A couple of them might never recover. I realize that I don't owe my physical survival to anyone, but it still would be a touch impolite of me to off myself, I think.So I just wander, like a ghost. I walk around. I walk and walk and walk. What is there to do? I make some music. Drink some beer, sometimes. Meet up with friends sometimes. Meditate. Play music.Truth be told (and are you still reading? bless you. thank you. it really means the world to me). Truth be told, I don't care about my success on a financial, material level. Like I really truly don't. But I am tired of people looking at me like there's something wrong with me. Or looking at me like some discoloured solid that came out of their nose.I know they say 'who cares what other people think' and I *don't* care, but I do!Or maybe it's this, if I may bring up another thread of this monologue, I'm pretty sure what I feel is the collective suffering of humanity. I think I've tapped into it. Yes, this is what's happened. I feel it, guys, I feel *humanity's* collective suffering. And i chose to. I deliberately chose to feel it because I don't want to cut myself off of it. I want to heal it. I want to take great big chunks of it and heal it. I know I can, and I regularly do.But I don't make any shield of any kind. My heart is open. There's no armour. You can look right in. You can hurt me. I allow it. If you wish to hurt me, you can. Because I don't want to close myself off to you, I want to be open. I want to be open to all of it.My assumption about most of us who contemplate suicide is that when we do, it's because we simply can't imagine continuing to exist physically, it's just so painful.But what I would prefer to do is commit a *selective* suicide, whereby the part of me that HOUNDS me and judges me and worries and speaks like I'm not good enough could die. Not the whole thing, see? We're not throwing the baby out with the bathwater.I just want to... drop it ALL.I just want to really, truly, finally, once and for all, stop giving a flying fuck about anything.No more being productive, no more getting stuff done, no more flat abs, not even hope for a better future. Just peace. Finally, some peace and quiet.Yeah.

653,"Hello dear ones,Let my foremost message be to you that I love you with all of my heart. I love you.There isn't any need to upvote this. Any mods who are reading this, please go right ahead and remove this. I'm not close to suicide, but I'm of the suicidal *mood*. This might be familiar to you, who are reading this, the feeling of utter despair, utter pointlessness, utter helplessness. God! The helplessness. And not even the type of helplessness - such as cancer - that's obvious, and brings tax-breaks, and sympathy.I want to talk about money, here. I am perpetually with very little money, as are many, as are most. It's within my capabilities - with the application of a little elbow-grease - to drum up some money. Perhaps even a lot. Perhaps millions! I feel the raw resources are here for me if I but simply chose to accept and apply them.I don't feel as though anything is outside of my capability. Truly! I can sense my raw power, my connection to the Source of things, my infinite creativity. There is no door that's closed to me.Except this: How could it be fair if I get rich? The way money, economy, is set up, not everyone can be rich. In order for someone to be rich, another needs to be poor my comparison.It's certainly true that all of us can have an abundance of food and water and so forth, but not everyone can have as much money as the richest amongst us. Equal opportunity - absolutely - but only a few of us at a time can be rich.And having much, much money means that you don't have to work so hard because you can invest and reinvest. Money just makes money. And I could spend it on all of the most expensive things.But how could I? As a conscientious human being, how could I possibly spend, say, $200 at a restaurant, when that could be a month's rent for someone in Asia? How could I? How could I go skydiving, or own a second house, or own a private plane if that wealth could save lives and give _PERSON_ mean, yes, having money means that I can give it away.But I feel as though it's wrong to stockpile money. That's what I think I'm getting at. Because if you think about it, all of the resources that money could possibly buy are neatly spread out all over the world. But the money itself is so concentrated.And it continues to drift upward. Like gravity, you know? It just makes its way to the largest stockpile in the same way that all rivers eventually lead to the ocean.And even if I were inclined to position myself near the center of such wealth stockpiles, I would necessarily need to be competitive, in order to do so. I would need to stand against one of my very own brothers, all descendants of _PERSON_ (metaphorically, of course) and convince myself that I'm more deserving than he is.How could I compete for money? How could I allow myself to be in possession of large money stockpiles? Especially when I myself need so very little? And it's true: I need very little. It might be said that I need more money than I have, but not that much more.Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I don't really want to stockpile it at all, but instead just participate in its *flow*. Open up a stream of it to come in, only to let it back out again. Like an ever-fresh stream. Yes.The other matter is this: expectations.I don't know from where they originate, but I can't seem to shake this feeling that something is being expected of me, and I don't know how to meet those expectations. I often dream of being able to exist in such a situation that I am left entirely alone, with nothing being asked of me, nobody is waiting for me impatiently.But I think I have high expectations of myself that I'm projecting on everyone in my life. I feel like I need to do something, but I don't know what. I just feel... pressure. Pressure. Pressure to do something. To do what? I don't know. But it's like I'm locked in this constant state of disappointing some nameless entity that resides within me.Disappointment. There's so much. Disappointment.  And in all of its phases, like impending disappointment, current disappointment, past disappointments. Helplessness, hopelessness. As a young boy there was so much promise about me, and now... none.How nice it would be to be already, say, 88 years old. And no one is expecting anything from this crotchety old many anymore. He's free to just read books and admire the sunrise.There's this voice in my head, not a voice, but a series of unarticulated thoughts that, when articulated, say:""I hate you, Brent. You're wasting your life. You should be working. You should be doing something. You don't deserve anything. Everyone hates you. You've made too many mistakes. You've wasted too much time. I am causing too much trouble to my parents. In this moment I am wrong, and am wasting time. You can't show your face anywhere, you do not want to be recognized for fear of embarrassment. You are embarrassing. Get to work. Follow some procedure. Stop delaying."" ""Waste."" ""Disappointment."" ""Leech."" ""Failure."" ""Pity."" When the words fade away, I'm left with these reddish feelings. A burning... sort of core? like an ember. A dense core of tension. Tight vibrations. It seems to shrink away and put up a shield when I inquire into it.Dark, muddy greens. Dark crimsons. Tightness in my chest, head, shoulders. Fear. Anxiousness. ""No!!"" ""Don't look at me, do your work first."" It says. And yet I can't seem to do anything else. This seems to be as far as I'm able to go. If you've read this, I really appreciate it.

656,"We've been friends for over 10 years, living together for the last 2. I've been noticing something wrong for the last few weeks. Quiet, in the room, but not really there. He was away over the weekend with his parents and when he came back he said he and his mom had gotten into a fight which I don't believe is normal for them. When I got home from work today, I didn't see him, so I got changed and knocked on his door to see if he was home. I didn't hear a response, but I knew he was home for some reason. I opened his door and saw him sleeping in his bed. No big deal, I thought, even though it was almost 7pm. He keeps a strange schedule sometimes, so it wasn't totally out of the ordinary. I let him sleep.About an hour later, he comes out very groggy, goes to the bathroom, and heads out to get cigarettes and beer. He goes into our back room to smoke, and I follow trying to get a feel on what's going on with him. He then tells me that he took sleeping pills and alcohol that afternoon to try to kill himself. Obviously I was and am in shock and didn't really know how to react. I asked questions about why and for how long he'd felt like this. We hugged it out at the end of the night and I told him I was there for him. No work is too important that he couldn't call me in the middle of the day and I'd be there.As a friend, I try not to pry too much and like to let my friends know I'm there to talk, but on their terms when they're ready. I just don't know what to do next. I said I wouldn't tell anyone, but I feel like I need help now.

We talked abit about his low self-esteem because he felt stupid and such, but I thought no more about it and went downstairs to my room.

I had a terribly rough 2014, but have tried to stay positive, but I just got hit with some terrible news this afternoon. I just found out that I have been dismissed from my University for the second time (I thought I wouldn't be dismissed this time because I have had serious mental problems ((cutting myself)) since August. To medicate, like most people on here, I have turned to the bottle. Now, it may seem like I am not drunk because my thoughts are both well thought out and spelled correctly, but that is just a facade. I drank tonight because I could not deal with the burden of telling my parents (I was forced to be hospitalized for a week a month ago because I cut myself to get away from the stress, and I honestly could not deal with going to the psych ward again), but I feel like I am out of options. My roommates are in Japan and Hawaii respectively, so I cannot turn to them for consolation, and I don't want to burden my friend who had taken me to the ER 3 times. I honestly don't know what to do, because I feel I am a huge letdown now, and as much as it pains me to say this, I am considering not living anymore just to make all of my problems go away. I know it is not the route I should take, but I don't know what else to do: I have fucked up my life so bad that I can't think of any other options that would make it any better........

To add insult to injury, Reddit is saying I can't post for 10 more minutes.

669,"During a depressed period during my high school years I contemplated suicide. Fortunately I sought help from professionals before doing anything and came out much better for it. Yet what one person whom I went to school with said when they found out I was suicidal has stuck with me forever and I will always owe that person a debt.I was selfish at the time, thought only of myself as teenagers often do. I figured it was my life, I could do what I wanted with it.That girl told me a simple line I wish the world could know.Your life is not entirely your own.You are your parents child, your grandparents grandchild, your friend's friend. You are your siblings sibling, your love's love and above all you are a part of the lives of everyone around you. Your leaving doesn't effect just you, it effects everyone you've ever known who learns of your passing. Your leaving causes pain, hurt, loss. Your life is not entirely your own.From this I have tried to live the best life I can while we can because my life means more than just my existence.This does not mean you shouldn't kill yourself out of guilt to what pain you will cause when you leave. It means you should find reasons to live and be great. Life is great when you remember to enjoy the simple things. Take a shower and *feel* the water. Sit down in the shower, it's wonderful and worth living for. Use cold water to remind you how nice hot water is. Use hot water to remind you how good cold water is. Walk outside and *breath* the air. *See* the sky, the ground and the leaves. *Taste* food, *smell* everything, *feel* something soft. We take for granted every day the best things in life. Smile at someone just because you can. It's amazing how many smiles you get back that just make your day. Depression surely sucks. It makes everything bland and sad. That doesn't mean it has to define you. Some of the greatest people who ever lived suffered from depression every day. My greatest hero, _PERSON_, suffered from depression and he changed the world and stopped the suffering of potentially billions of people. Lincoln was sure he wasn't cut out for politics or the presidents office. He was full of self doubt and worry. He thought he would ruin America. Instead he became arguably the greatest president to ever live because he didn't let depression or suicidal thoughts win. He fought every day to make things better. [The list of how many people live and lived with major depression disorder will shock you.](_URL_ suicidal means you think things can only get worse or never get better. You probably think you're worthless. I'm going to tell you this isn't true. Your life is worth *everything*. To me, to your loved ones, to anyone who has known you. You have value. You have meaning. All you have to do is believe it. Come back to the world. It is a wonderful place because we can feel pain. Because we suffer we know what is good. Because we have pain we know pleasure.

671,"Hello, you don't know me. I come to you with a desperate plea because I have no friends to confide in so I must confide with strangers on the Internet. At least you guys seem to be an amiable bunch that are more likely to help out than tell me to kill myself (which I have to admit has come across my mind more than a few times in the recent past). I've posted this on another subreddit and I don't know your rules on multiple posting, but if I don't get help soon, I fear what I might do.I need life advice. Ever since I've left high school, my life has been nothing but a string of failure after failure. I was originally accepted to the University of Waterloo in Ontario, for an ambitious program that combined a computer science degree with an accounting degree. I originally wanted to be just computer science, but with influence from my accountant mother, she encouraged me to take CompSci with Accounting.I moved out, then something in my head just switched. In high school, I was a responsible honor roll student who got all As with little to no effort. When I moved out, I just let go of everything. All my classes started failing, I got sucked into different computer games that sucked up all my time, starting with _PERSON_, then into League of Legends. After I moved out of the dorm without steady internet, I realized how wretched of a person I could become. I remember that after every class, instead of going somewhere to study, I went to one of the common rooms with my PC, mouse and mousepad ready, hooked up and just played League of Legends until an ungodly hour before returning to my room to sleep. I've also downloaded a porn game and fapped to it until 5 am in the morning, making me unable to go to class the next day.After a straight year of mediocre marks, my parents and I agreed that maybe Waterloo was too difficult of a university and that I should go to an easier university. Better to do well in a lesser university than to do bad in a good university right?Well, moving to York University initially wasn't so bad. I did get good marks initially. But this year, I've once again failed my parents and myself. My League of Legends addiction stayed, causing me to play instead of studying, causing me to bomb my midterms on two of my major courses, causing me to drop one and end up getting a D in the other. I never paid attention in class, I was too proud and stupid to think that I needed to. ""I would read that on my own"" I said to myself, but I never did since my nights were filled with League. Since I also repeated an accounting course that I needed for an internship but didn't get the mark I needed last semester, but since I kept forgetting to do online assignments and didn't pay attention in class, I ended up getting a worse mark than before. I'm very lucky that the internship office said that they could make exceptions if my GPA was high enough.Now, with the beginning of my new semester, my ol' faithful ASUS laptop that fed my addiction to all of my video games for the past 4 years has died and I've managed to get some time to think about my life. I decided that I would start paying attention in class, start studying and stop playing so much games, especially since the laptop I have now can only play shitty games.However, my dad just talked to me about an hour before I typed this. He and my mom have been nothing but supportive of me throughout my failure at Waterloo, but my recent failings has recently driven them over the edge. My mom, who was usually a taskmaster behind me in high school and my main motivation for getting good marks often came from her, has become more dismissive and pessimistic about me and my schooling. My dad picked up on this and after hearing about me fucking up last semester has issued an ultimatum.If I don't start pulling my marks up (and B's are probably not going to cut it), he said that he no longer wanted to feel like a failure as a father and wants me to live alone. For the past 20 years of my life, he has offered nothing but support and fatherly advice, but I have never done any of it. I can't blame him for wanting to kick me out. I've wasted so much money with my failure and appear to want nothing more but to play games all day and night.I don't know what to do. I want to believe that I can study and do better in school, but I don't know if I can at this point. I have already promised myself the same thing multiple times in the past, but I always seem to forget the strife and pain that I went through just a few months before and fall into old habits.I've already feel guilty about all the shit I've put my parents through and it's beginning to affect my head. Ever since I've failed those midterms last semester, every time I go through any kind of emotional stress, I've been getting these intrusive thoughts in my head. ""Maybe you should just kill yourself,"" they say. After I hear these things in my head, I always find myself going down a train of thought analyzing the benefits of suicide, how it would help my parents not have to feel as failures anymore and how I wouldn't have to worry about disappointing them anymore. I'm scared of what my own mind is doing that is seemingly out of my control.Even with suicidal thoughts and all of my parents efforts, I am very afraid of falling back into the cycle of improving, then forgetting and returning to old habits that will cause failure. I'm lost. I cannot tell anyone in my life about this. All of my friends wouldn't know what to tell me and probably couldn't tell me much but basic uplifting tropes and shit. I don't want to put all of my emotional baggage on them. They don't deserve it, they have their own lives to worry about.The only glimmer of hope I see is that I have been successfully working out at home using workout videos. Although most of my drive to get in shape was to get ""a pornstar body"" (I'm really fucking motivated by sex for some reason), it's about the only good thing I have going for me. Hell, that might be the only way I could make money when my dad kicks me out and I have to start whoring my self out.Please, I need help. I need a third party to tell me what to do. I keep seeing the pattern of my life but I just can't seem to break the cycle. With my dad about to kick me out, I'm really afraid that if I don't pull my marks up and turn myself around, I may end up on the news no more than a year later as a dead man who hanged himself in a local alley.I'm not currently suicidal right now, but I know that if I can't pull this life off soon, I will have good reason to be. Any kind of advice is needed, even if it's just a redirection to a larger advice subreddit. I've tried to find one but Google didn't help me this time.

682,What can I really say about my life? For starters I've never had the easiest of child hoods growing up ranging from traumatic moments such as seeing a friends brother take his own life. Or the days of emotional abuse or boarder line sexual abuse. Besides all that I grew up to be a pretty promising young man. I was very fortunate in my life to have good friends and a caring family. but my repressed memories from my child hood have always had something dark brewing inside me. (no not poop you guys) How can I explain it? When I smile I am inside but I simply am not there nothing just a blank sheet of paper. I am simply not there. my latest life crisis has hit me over the scales of insanity the hardest. I'll explain freshmen year I met the greatest girl so far in my life at the age of 14. we had a great relationship that lasted for four years until her new found friend ruined it. Allow me to elaborate I couldn't say I was the worst of boyfriend nor was I the best but I was never one to beat or be abusive which I take great pride in. The problem you wonder? in the past two weeks I have lost my job and one of my friends died of cancer. the other took his own life. and I've lost my girlfriend  &gt;:l.At this point in life I've given up all regards for my own personal safety my hobbies have become more dangerous. climbing radio towers jumping off bridges on to passing trains. playing Russian roulette. The worst part of all this is I'm at the point where I no longer feel suicidal but homicidal.  Its like diet coke and mentos in a bottle and I'm ready to snap and unleash a new hell the world has never seen before. I know I couldn't bring myself to take a life but the more my mind dwells on the ways I'd like to get revenge the more just the idea becomes and sounds. The furthest my stunt has ever gone was sitting outside of one of the peoples who have wronged me work place and chilling at the job area with piano wire in my bag stalking them. I don't know what is going on inside of me and I don't like it I need to tell my parents about this but for some reason I choke up when I think about getting help.

683,"Ok so I don't really know where to begin but I need to let this out because otherwise it's going to kill me.I guess I should start off by saying I'm currently at university, have a lovely girlfriend who I love very much and a supportive family. They have done so much to support me through all of this and I just can't find a way to express myself so I guess this is me trying to find a way to open so this will probably turn out very rambling and poorly punctuated and for that I apologize in advance.Ok so I really enjoy my degree it's awesome but I've been miserable here since the day I first started. OVer the course of my 3 years I have systimatically destroyed or alienated myself from pretty much everyone I beame freinds with. I can't explain this other than have real abandonment issues due to leaving home at 17 because I simply couldn't get along with my parents and they asked me to leave home. I guess I've never gotten over this despite the fact in recent years I have developed a good relationship with my mum and an ok(ish) one with my dad and they are both very supportive.At uni I feel really isolated and alone and this eats me up mainly because I know that deep down part of the reason I am alone is due to my own self destructive behaviors and the way they drive the people in my life away.So now we're getting to the end of the 3rd year of university and my friends (what ones I have left) are all graduating and so is my gf. This has been worrying me because I've barely coped this year with them around and I have no clue how I'm going to survive my last year without them. Anyway on the day in question I just couldn't face it anymore I got up I packed my things and I left my gf's like any other day when I went home to go play video games only today I didn't.Instead I went to the park I sat in the sun texted the people I loved to tell them that I loved them then I took my entire months supply of lithium in one go. after a while i started to panic and I knew I had to make sure my brother knew I lvoed him and that I was sorry (at this point he was the only one I hadn't spoken to as he was at work) as time went on I panicked that there was no way that I could leave the world without him knowing how much I cared.one thing led to another and I ended up in hospital with my gf trying to comfort me as I was vomiting and had diarrhea for hours. Man I never thought it would end there was just more and more and more. After 18 hours of laxatives being fed to me to flush my system my lithium levels showed I was bewlow a dangerous point but ahd to stay in hospital until the psych team could get a cnosult to me. I was eventually discharged without having to be admitted to the psych unit YAY!!!!!However now role on two weeks of me snapping at the GF who I love with all my heart being unable to to talk to the friends I have left and being horribly uncomfortable in peoples company but even more uncomfortable in just my own and shes back in Denmark.I can't sleep because everytime I close my eyes I'm scared that I'm going to open them and I'm going to be back in that hospital in the psych unit and I've just been dreaming they let me go, I';m having 4-5 panic attacks ona daily basis and even when I do sleep I wake up panicked due to panic attacks in my dreams that the spread over into real panic attacks. Right now I'm really scared I've wanted to hurt myself before but never to just destroy myself and I'm scared I'm goig to end up right back there and I just don't know what to do.Oh and yes I'm now in contact with my local mental health team and am on the waiting list for access to a community psychiatric nurse but the waiting list is 3 months and I'll be back at uni by then.edit edit for typos _PERSON_ probably missed some but I had 3 panic attacks and a crying spell whilst writing this.",1,26,762,begin kill guess start university lovely girlfriend love supportive family support find express guess find open turn rambling poorly punctuated apologize advance enjoy degree awesome miserable day started years systimatically destroyed alienated pretty beame freinds explain real abandonment issues due leaving home simply parents asked leave home guess fact recent years developed good relationship mum ish dad supportive uni feel isolated eats deep part reason due destructive behaviors drive people life end year university friends left graduating gf worrying barely coped year clue survive year day question face anymore packed things left gf day home play video games today didn park sat sun texted people loved loved entire months supply lithium started panic knew make brother knew lvoed point spoken work time panicked leave world knowing cared thing led ended hospital gf comfort vomiting diarrhea hours man thought end hours laxatives fed flush system lithium levels showed bewlow dangerous point ahd stay hospital psych team cnosult eventually discharged admitted psych unit yay role weeks snapping gf love heart unable talk friends left horribly uncomfortable peoples company uncomfortable back denmark sleep everytime close eyes scared open back hospital psych unit dreaming panic attacks ona daily basis sleep wake panicked due panic attacks dreams spread real panic attacks scared wanted hurt destroy scared goig end back contact local mental health team waiting list access community psychiatric nurse waiting list months back uni edit edit typos person missed panic attacks crying spell whilst writing,27.0,26.0,5,15,2,18,9,17,10,19

I was with her for almost 4 years, we were in a LDR that eventually took it's toll, the break up was mutual even though I didn't really want it. I gave her the choice in the end and that is the way things turned out. In those first few weeks of January I was struggling but I was okay, then on February she broke the news that she was already seeing someone, it hadn't even really been a month and she had already jumped into things with someone else, this was the moment that I broke. All my fears, all my self hatred came boiling to the front from my past a past she knew well enough of. I became worthless, she had moved on so quickly and it broke me and made me feel like all of a sudden I was worthless. I loved her I told her, I never wanted any of this, I broke down bearing all my emotions that I had hid. I wanted to die. I had to see a therapist and take medication from that moment forward because of what wad done. Fast forward 2 months later, she tells me he is taking her to Hawaii for her birthday, thanks for telling me that, they get engaged there. She sends me a picture of the moment, a picture of her hand on top of his with the ring on her finger. We were supposed to get married and have kids. This not supposed to be how this ended. The picture is the same picture me and her took when we were dating of my hand holding hers in the final day of her visiting me, we were waiting at the airport for her flight home. That was supposed to be my hand holding hers with the ring on her finger. We were together for almost 4 years, they knew each 3 months. I still love her, every day. I wake up wishing I had never woken because of what she has done to me. I hope she sees this. I know she feels guilty she told me so but I don't think she really cares at all, if she did none of this would of happened. She only really ever cared about herself, even in our relationship, she put herself first instead of us. I worked hard for us, working a full time job and going to school full time while she stayed at home with her dad doing nothing. I spent every poor penny I had for her. I sacrificed friends and even spending time with family for her. I was there for her in her pain dealing with her mother and her sister. I was always doing things for her. I hope she sees this.

I've gone to therapy, taking medication but it's not enough she is still there.. I pushed her away, I broke her heart in that moment last June, I didn't work hard enough for her, then in January after we had spent some time trying to work on things it all ended. I don't think she loved me anymore.. Almost 4 years we were together, she is my soul mate, my best friend and the love of my life and I let it all go, I let my depression get the better of me and I pushed her away... Now I regret it every day.. 1 month after we ended she found someone else, 2 months later they went to Hawaii and she got engaged.. I was supposed to be the one to marry her and we were supposed to have kids together start a family, now I am alone again, I have nobody, I would spend all my time with her because we were long distance, every waking moment, I pushed aside friends and family for her, I worked full time and went to school full time for her, I gave everything I had to give us a life, but in the end it wasn't enough... He is well off she tells me, can give her what she wants, what we wanted.. All I wanted was for you to help me, build our relationship so we could work to that goal, now she found someone who gives her a chance to be a housewife and stay at home mom just like she always wanted... She got everything she wanted in an instant when she met him.. Didn't really have to lift a finger to do it.. And I was the one who was left behind to pick up the pieces of my heart, to see the ring on her finger in a moment that should of been ours to share... Just like that last night on our first dates when she was flying home.. The true moments I fell in love with her, when I knew she would be my forever... Why do I still dream of her? Why do I cry for her almost every day? I try to push forward, take up new hobbies, excersizing again, try to focus on work but nothing helps, I still wake up with my heart breaking every day, knowing she is not lying next to me like it used to be..

710,"Truthfully it could be worse, my mother was a serial suicidalist. I revived her once when I was 13. We were living on the second floor of a warehouse that usually housed migrant workers. It was rat-infested and the walls were smeared up to waist-high with thousands of children's hand-prints. I was undergoing treatment for rheumatic fever and was bed-ridden. My father woke me at 5 a.m., ""I can't wake your mama up, come see what you can do"". I went in, she was prone in bed her lips were blue. I grabbed her hand and she was cold, I shook her and there was no response, her breathing was so shallow as to be undetectable. My father stood in the doorway ashen faced, ""Go make her some tea"" I barked. I tried giving her spoonfuls of it but her jaw was stiffened. I got angry and sat astride her stomach, drew back my right hand and slapped her twice. She feebly reached up and tapped me on the cheek, she was alive. ""Go to a pay-phone and call the fucking ambulance!"" I screamed. Daddy scooted out to the corner phone, the hospital was just 2 minutes away. They came and hauled her away down the steps, I watched from the porch. She fought them as they tried to pump her stomach, she had eaten close to a hundred librium.She survived that attempt but had tried before after driving cross-country and OD'ing in a motel room. She eventually drown herself in the ocean after disappearing for 2 days in a spot not far from where I lived.I was the only one in the family that did not totally lose it. I held us together. I was 21 at the time. Mama had been living with my oldest sister who also had a history of suicide attempts, she was devastated and required years of psychotherapy and was committed twice.

718,"I've been battling suicidal thoughts since August of 2009.  That's when my _PERSON_ took his life.  I'm an only child and never got the chance to truly greive since I was slung into being the man of the house and had to be strong.  6 months ago, I started reaching out for help due to the massive swings in depression around the times of his birthday and the day that he passed (approx. 6 months apart).  I went to a counselor who seemed distracted and more worried about what time she was leaving than listening to me.  She was truly a waste of time.  I talked to my general prac. at the same time and was prescribed an antidepressant to help.  It did.  I don't really have any close friends anymore because I moved away from home after college and left all of my friends behind.  I've been here 2 years and have a few acquaintances, but no true friends.  I still talk to my mom and her parents, but that's about it as far as family goes.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who truly is the light of my life and I really think the reason I've made it this far is because of her.  Well, I made a huge mistake and I've really pissed her off enough that she just walked out on me.

719,"I'm a lonely guy.I like to have people around me, I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I mean, who doesn't like attention (that isn't at the detriment to the person providing it to you) and affection (again, as long as it's mutually beneficial)?I turned 19 without so much as a kiss on the cheek from a pretty girl or anything of that nature. I was comfortable with this, that's not why I'm depressed.I met my now ex-girlfriend in the library quad at my university. She was sleeping on one of the planter's. God, she was very pretty, but I didn't want to disturb her to make inane conversation. Luckily for me, she wakes up when she hears me rustling through my bag rather loudly (I lied, I did want to wake her up).So we strike up a conversation, and a month later, we're on our first date. She's wonderful, everything about her is wonderful. Her entire being is radiant, inside, outside, spiritually...everything about her is perfect. This is the girl I've waited for, this is the one God (not to disrespect any nonbelievers that may be present in this sub) wanted to bless me with.We have sex. She can tell that I'm inexperienced, and she's okay with it. She says I'm handsome, I'm a gentleman, that I'm ""too good of a guy."" I say it all back to her, but because I mean it and not because I'm getting some.She comes over every weekend. She steals my sweatshirts, she reorganizes my disaster area of a room. I clean her room, I make her breakfast. We even go to the bathroom together because we don't want to be separated from each other for more than a few seconds. We take naps together, watch movies together, we cook, eat, clean, live together. She's got a drinking problem. Drunk every weekend. I don't deride her for her proclivities because my loneliness has effectively been killed, and I'm in love.With love comes responsibility, though. So, out of love, I tell her that I'm worried about her drinking. That I'd be upset if anything bad happened to her. She's come to pick me up from my place nearly black out drunk before, and I don't know how she operated a motor vehicle without hurting herself or someone else.This past Friday, she calls me and tells me we need to talk. I arrive at her place with her favorite foods: A large coke and a reese's peanut butter cup package from the local gas station. I give them to her and she sighs, and so I begin to worry.She tells me that she's feeling suffocated, and that it's not my fault. She says she isn't ready for me, and she drops that phrase again, that I'm ""too good for her."" She says she needs to get her act together before she can keep seeing me the way she's been seeing me. She says I'm right about her drinking. She says that this needs to be put on hold ""indefinitely.""I can't wait that long. Indefinitely is a long time if you think about it for long enough (heh, irony). She kisses me goodbye, and shuts the door on me.I go home to my mother. My eyes are bloodshot from the tears I've been crying. She asks what's wrong and I tell her everything. I tell her what I said to my ex-girlfriend. That I was concerned about her drinking.My mother tells me that maybe I need to ""shut my trap"" the next time around in her own special way of comforting me. This doesn't help. Not a bit. So I've been crying in my room every night for the past few days, hoping I can just get over this and move on with life, but it doesn't come that easy when you're in the real world.I've been trying to drown myself in work. I've opted to work the late shift just so I can sleep all day so I don't have to think about her. I get to work and it's always slow.

723,"I have friends and a loving family that I hate. The family is unable to help me at anything and they know it; they compensate by being extraordinarily accommodating.             * Friends, I have a few good ones and lots of ones who are better described as friendly - drinking buddies, etc. I tried to be friends with them before realizing I don't actually like them. As most experienced in this kind of trauma can tell, friends can't really help in these kind of situations. Oh, you ""love me and will always be there for me?"" That does not really mean anything. The better friends might be great cheerleaders, but we have to face our demons all by ourselves and in the darkest of times their clichéd words all but distant muted noise that does not matter.I tried getting better with girls I find pretty. I got better, and would get them to show interest. Like they'd get all bubbly and lit up when I awkwardly tried flirting. But the moment they opened up and showed they liked me, I shut down. Like Madagascar.  There is no way they'd get me. Or still like me when I show my weakness and show that I'm not the idealized essence of alpha that a girl would want. Plus why the fuck would I want to share my weak struggle with my monsters to anyone. I'm quite ashamed about being weak enough to have to deal with this.I still kept trying. You would not believe it, why would some guy try pickup and not actually respond when girls open up. I almost turned asexual. Don't trust anyone really.* I'm not angry about most people. It's not their fault that they can't or won't try to help. First, life is pretty occupying leaving us with not enough time or energy to just help around. Second, we don't really have the ability to help anyone. There is always great distances we can't reach. The person is stuck in a maze in his own mind in his own altered, skewed perspective battling monsters all to real and all too absurd that they are almost powerless to fight off. * And all we can do is watch, and tell ourselves it only happens to other people. Its like a footage of a train-wreck that happened decades ago and is now forgotten. Somehow that makes it okay, because although none of it really is nice, we need coping mechanisms to be able to live in this reality we find ourselves in. But the guy in the train that day did not want to be in a video in _PERSON_. He just wanted to be, reading a nice book in a train while travelling off to the snow-covered towns in Chile or see the wild, burning wastes of the Australian outback. He wanted to do photography, write and travel and be loved for it. He wanted to have figured out what he wanted to do with his life already and be good at it. He wanted to have dressed stylishly that day and wear the sexiest rugged brown boots. He wanted to have long hair and a short beard. He wanted to be awesome. He wanted to teach his father how to express emotions so he could tell him he's proud of him. He wanted to show his mom how not to be scared of everything and not be depressed all the time. He wanted to show his sister that being a corporate sell-out is okay and she should not punish herself so much for it and she need not abandon all the cool and creative little things she loved for it.* Well actually I don't feel completely suicidal *now* but I know it'll be back. It's always back. I can still feel the presence, almost mocking me lovingly. ""Aww you."" ""I hope you make it.""* This is what happens. I fight it back. The darkness. Every day. Every day I'm more tired and weak of it all. Sick of having to go through the fight. Ashamed of being weak and cowardly enough to not take drastic changes to actually solve all of this.I lost 50 pounds in eight months by simply willing myself to do it. I did not take in the calories. No exercise, no running, nothing. I simply willed myself into the discipline. That takes a lot away.* I don't think I can do something like that though. I used to write well. I spent thousands of hours writing. Published hundreds of pieces in dailies. Now I feel like I'm writing total crap. I played brain age today and got 22 which is one year younger than my age. That's the highest score I ever got. But I was convinced the game was being condescending and gave me extra points because it took pity on me. That's actually what I felt.* We come here on SuicideWatch because we needed someone to care for ourselves. Then we see others suffer and in pain and we empathize and we try our best to help. We put our pain aside and try to help our fellow man. This is incredibly kind. * Sometimes what they're suffering for seems trivial. Sometimes the enormity of their situation scares us. We hide our true assessments and go help anyway, knowing full well rarely people have climbed back from depths like these. But we try. We feel compelled to help. To be excellent to the ones who suffer. Somebody has to.It does not end up mattering though. The person we're rooting for and pouring our hearts out for is stuck somewhere else. In an altered plane were our kind words scroll away as meaningless statistics and news from a war you do not care about. He now knows there are people who are uncomfortable that he's suffering. There are people who are trying to help. They might even like him. * But it does not matter. In the city that does not exist, on he and his monsters are there. It's only upto him to fight. To hold back the tide. To make sense of what he will that there are people who want him to win. * But it's dark and deep and so far away from anyone. It's slightly cold and you almost feel the wind. It's really empty. Only he's there, eyes open wide and looking about in the middle of the street. And sometimes even the monsters are not there with him.**tldr; Outside the window the sky is a milky blue. I can see a pink and red building and green as cucumber trees.

744,"Hi guys, I’m just going to lay it out since my writing goes to hell when I’m in this sort of state. I’m 28, I have suicidal depression, social anxiety, general anxiety, self harm, I’m 100lb overweight (down from 200lb), horribly abusive family and last but worst, OCD (tactile hypersensitivity, to make a long story short, the inability to tolerate feelings like the seams in clothing has gutted my life).Because of the above reasons, high school almost killed me. Shortly after graduating and after a particularly bad family fight I got on a train and moved cross country to the west coast, hoping that distance and a big new city would give me the chance I needed to live a real life. 3 months later I found that separation anxiety from the abusive family was crippling me with panic attacks and I moved home. I really can’t explain it other than, we’ve all seen the cops tv shows where the woman is battered and bloody and refuses to press charges on the guy that did it because maybe if she does just the right thing, maybe then he’ll love her? Its like that I guess. So I came home. I had enough sense in me to know I couldn’t come back to my family’s house so I moved in with extended family who was close. They treated me mostly the same and after 4 years of that (long time I know, but punishment is what I know) I took off again to the east coast with the same hopes of a real life. Falling apart this time at 4 months and coming home, this time to the original family house. I’ve been back for 2 years now, and its worse than ever. I spend 22 hours a day in a room in the basement crying from panic attacks and cutting myself to shreds. The other 2 hours I face the family which gives me enough punishment to do another 22 hours here.I don’t ever see it getting better for me. I’ve run to both ends of the country and failed both times. If I make it long enough, I’ll run again, but I know how that ends. I just got a disability letter partially approving me, but I don’t even care because even if I could get the money to move myself away, it would just be another room to sit and die in…until the anxiety drove me home again.  The only thing I even really want in life, honestly, was a relationship, someone to love and be loved by. Having never really felt it before, I have it so built up in my head that it must be wonderful. But being 100lb overweight, having no career and no money, and social anxiety that leaves me shaking and sick if I even try to say Hi to someone, I don’t think I’ll ever have that. And if I can’t have it, there’s no real consolation prize that is worth staying around for. I’ve wanted to die since I was 14, I’m utterly ashamed that I’ve spent 14 more years wanting it and not doing it while making almost no forward progress on fixing myself. And I have tried to fix myself. I’ve been in therapy for 7 years. Been on 2 dozen anti depressants. Tried every support group I’ve been able to. I’ve got a self help library that will thrill the local library when they inherit it. I had bariatric surgery and lost 70 of the 100 pounds I mentioned before. Nothing has ever removed the lump in my throat, every morning that I’ve woken up for 14 years has hurt to realize I’m alive for another day. For the first time in my life I got a reprieve 3 months ago. Its crazy but bear with me. After reading a study from johns Hopkins on magic mushrooms treating depression I tried it myself and got similar results. Within 2 days I felt what I imagine normal happy people must feel like all the time. I wasn’t sad, I was just ok, and after having been sad most of my life, being ok was the best feeling I’ve ever felt. I still had all of the real problems I listed but I felt like the sky was the limit, I was going to work my ass off and fix these things and surely within 2 or 3 years I was going to have that life I spent so much time fantasizing about. I bought a bike and put 1000 miles on it in 2 months and lost 30 more lb. For 2 months I didn’t cry once or use a single ativan for a panic attack. It physically felt like there was a burden lifted from me, being alive didn’t feel like walking through mud anymore. But optimism alone doesn’t save you when everything around you wants to tear you down. Christmas kicked my ass, my family had no tolerance for this new up beat person and worked double time to hurt him. It worked, I lost the grip I had on my new happiness. At 3 months, I tried the mushroom thing again and it has not worked as well as before, maybe a little, but then I’m still writing this letter tonight after all. Its left me heartbroken, to have seen the light and had it pried out of my hands. And what is there left to try to get it back? Which by the way is my most important question here, what do I have left to try? I’m 28 with nothing, even if I had that happiness back and it stayed, I would be 30 something before I ever had a life. And I don’t see how someone can make a real life at that point, it would be more of a patchwork _PERSON_ in the shape of a real life. Anyway, I’ve droned on too long anyway, sorry for beating you with a wall of text if you’ve made it this far, I can add to it in replies if needed.

745,"I don't want to ask in /r/asklegal because they'll get hung up on the wrong part of the question. If I thought there was something that could be said to prevent the suicide in the first place, Id be asking that instead. I don't have much to leave behind. I would like to leave one friend my camera and hard drive full of my work, then my laptop to another friend. But neither lives close enough to get it themselves, it would have to be mailed. And then finally I wanted to be cremated and have my ashes sent to the first friend (they've agreed). The problem is my family won't be cooperative with any of it, they won't want to give up items they could keep themselves and they certainly won't respect the cremation or giving the ashes away. How do you enforce any of it? It seems like once the police take the body away the apartment will just be left alone and the next people to come in will be my family, who can then just tear up a will and throw it away, or take the items and say they never saw them. Same goes with the ashes, the coroner will ask the family what they want done and they'll tell him their wishes, not mine.Does anyone know how this would work out? I guess I could take care of part of it by mailing the items myself before hand, but I feel like when I finally get the nerve, the time between deciding to do it and doing it will be too quick to get side tracked with mailing stuff tomorrow.

746,"I'm 28 now, the depression became suicidal at 14, life wasn't very good before that and I don't remember much before 10. I've wanted to die for almost all of my memorable life. I work so hard at getting better, but it's not really ""getting better"" because I was never ok to begin with, I don't even know what it's like to feel like a normal person. To think that now, in what would be the middle of a normal life, I'm going to pull it all together and be able to do all of the things I've never been able to do? How realistic is that?Besides the depression I deal with OCD, social anxiety, normal anxiety and a horrible family. Since I was little it left me too scared of people to have friends and too tormented by the OCD to do much but stay home and hide, and that family and the anxiety to tear me apart while I did that. College was out of the question for the same reasons, but eventually I felt that if I could just get away from the damage the family was doing, I could be happy. I tried twice, at 20 and 24 I moved to either end of the country. I fell apart both times within 3 months, I don't know why, a lot of anxiety I suppose and at this point I'm a codependent on that messed up family. I moved out for a 3rd time and I'm 3 month into it now. I don't want to go home but it's made me realize something worse. I finally got out and separated myself from them and nothing is any better. I live off of a little savings that will eventually run out. I worry constantly about the money, it's not the ocd that keeps me in anymore but the cost of going out and the anxiety of it all anyway. I can't find a job, I'm not cut out for anything but washing dishes and even that causes a breakdown after a few weeks because of the ocd. I'm too depressed to work on my own business, that takes so much from even a normal person, I was crazy to think I could do it. And most importantly, I still can't have a relationship or even friends. Even if there were places for me to go, I'm too scared of people to do anything other than sit at the side and avoid them. I have such big fantasies of finding love and it's ridiculous because I can't even say ""hi"" to a person.Looking back, it was easier to be in that messed up household with the family because I could always tell myself ""it'll be better as soon as you get out"" it was something to keep hope alive. Now that I'm out and still as crippled as ever, what do I tell myself? ""It'll get better if you just give it 6 months""? I told myself that at 16, that it must get better, there was no way a person could feel like this for years and years, and now here I am more than a decade later feeling the same way. I STILL tell myself that, there's no way I could possibly be 40 or 50 and still be like this, but I find threads on reddit all the time of 40 and 50 year olds talking about their lifelong depression.So many huge things about me that would have to change to feel better, when I've never even made progress on a single one. I'm going to be that 50 year old talking about how he was depressed since 14. Or maybe not, the money is going to run out in a year and I won't even be able to be that 50 year old. No part of me believes I will ever be better, I never have been. I've never seen anyone like me that has gotten better. I haven't even seen many like me that have lived this long, you don't go 14 years wanting to die, you get better or you kill yourself much sooner than that.What the hell do I do? Everyone wants to just say keep hanging on, it'll get better. But I do, and it doesn't. How long are you supposed to hang on and keep fooling yourself into thinking it'll ever be better? And would it matter? If I grit my teeth and live another 30 years so I can die of old age, crying all the way? My life is over, it never started. I knew that at 14. I was just too conflicted to kill myself because I hoped there would be some proof that it could get better. That's what keeps me here now, because what if something happens tomorrow to change everything? So I struggle to tomorrow and nothing happens. At what point am I allowed to give up? And I sit here now writing this hoping someone can say something to help, but there is nothing. In 14 years of this I've heard it all and none of it has helped.

I finished highschool and went to college, like pretty much any youth and that's pretty much when everything fell apart. First year went fine, then I failed in 2nd year, then I failed in 3rd year, again and again .. I'm 25 now and I still have no bachelor. I tried finding programming jobs a few months and a few years ago but everything just feels like it's there to expose what a fraud I am. Even opening NetBeans or another IDE, it just feels like its there to expose what a fraud I am. I sometimes have small outbursts of honest work (yesterday I managed to figure out how to read a RSS feed into java) but not too much. When I used to go to an interview my only thought was 'time to show again what an imposter I am'. Living off minimum wage in this country is unsustainable and my parents are miserable because of my situation. I honestly feel that it's too late for me to fix anything anymore and any effort I make is just a baby step compared to the giants that are my peers. Killing myself doesn't feel like a tragic episode, but more like a darwinian one. Weaklings like me are expelled from society. I am terribly shamed for my family and even throwing my life away just feels like too little a punishment ... I also filed an euthanasia request to my family doctor and he rejected it.

748,"Hello,I realize some people might recognize me for advice/input of low and medium quality I throw around here. The truth is I have become a regular here because the feelings end up being overwhelming. I already have another thread here, but I hope it's not too selfish to make another one, it feels like shouting out in a great dark void where nothing gets out.Anyway, I'm 25 now, eastern europe, and I have nothing to myself. Being pretty lonely as a child my best friends were video games. I wanted to create other 'best friends' for other people when I would grow up so after I graduated high school I got in at a Computer Science faculty. As a person, I almost never take decisions, if that makes any sense. I always walk around with my hands stretched out, and if someone wants to grasp it and pull me on their side, I follow. I guess that's why I liked almost every object of study in highschool and accepted every seminar or whatever that someone walked up and offered to me (including religious ones). I end up feeling that this modum esse ended up hurting me more in the long run. First year of college, everything went fine, but second year, everything went downhill, and really fast, really bad. All the friends I made dropped out, the new professors had a very different attitude and I just ended up feeling alienated. I believe this is the 6th year of college in a 3 year program and my parents said they'd rather not support this endeavor anymore (somehow I passed to 3rd but I still have stuff left from 2nd)I'm also starting to feel weird when I'm at some place that I'm not intimate with. Whenever I would have to turn in homework, my heart would pump out really hard, my head would start asking itself questions repeatedly and I start being afraid that I would be exposed as a fraud. I went out with people I don't know and one of my two friends to a place I dont know. Needless to say, I felt terrible. I would sweat constantly, always playing with my cigarettes or my lighter, randomly playing with my phone, etc. I don't think I said a word that night.I tried getting a job. Programming companies rejected me all the time, probably because I don't know too much due to my modum esse. Last interview I had was for a java developer position, I was shocked to see I only got 42% of their questions correct. Which brings me to my next issue, is that I forget a lot. Stuff that I knew at some point are slowly fading out of my memory when they shouldnt be. I thought I knew _PERSON_ at least on an intermediary level, seems that was not the case. Programming a massive project by myself feels incredibly scary, I don't even know where I would start. The only job I managed to hold was as a database manager for some mail delivery company. I had three bosses which abused the living hell out of me, calling me names, mocking me, asking questions about my intimate life, until I couldn't take it anymore and I just quit. Home I was berated by my family for doing that.Home doesn't feel like home anymore. I've been berated so many times for playing games or watching movies or TV Shows on my computer I cannot get any enjoyment from them, even when I'm alone at home. I jog some evenings when I don't feel completely exhausted and during warm evenings I go to the park and play chess or backgammon with lonely old men. A kind redditor suggested to me to try to go teach english in other places. I tried looking up for an english test and they're pretty expensive. But at least its something to think about, something I can latch to.Ever since I started to feel this insane pressure coming from multiple sides, I've been thinking about suicide since, to be fair, it never gets better by itself unless some angel comes and I don't have strength to carry on anymore. I feel like something that should have been rightfully mine has been given away to someone else. Even my girlfriend got tired of me and dumped me and my meaningless existence. I feel an unchanneled thirst for revenge, some kind of spite for society and the way it treated me. I tried talking about it to other people, first about the suicide to 'test the waters' and then about the strange feelings I'm experiencing. I tried bringing it up to my family : mother doesn't even want to hear about it, father ridicules me. My little cousin (21) thinks I'm someone who says it for attention (am I?) and if I really wanted to do it I would (would I?). Not even my two dear, dear friends really understand me. One of them ridicules me for my feelings of revenge, and the other one just listens, doesn't offer any input at all. In the end, all I am is a walking joke, and it only makes sense to put my existence away. I live at the 10th floor, maybe after a few too many shots in a bad night I could bring myself to do it, since I'm literally too stupid to know how to find barbs or any other convenient method. I realize my problems are nothing compared to what other people here are facing, and that I am taking away precious first page space for people who truly are in dire straits and not complete fuck ups like me.

749,"I'm not even sure what to think anymore. I'm quite healthy as far as physically. I'm thankful for the family and friends I have..to have a job, and so much more. But, why do we live this life? What's the point of continuing on if you can never be happy eternally? Sure, we experience happiness numerous amount of times. They say we have to take the bad with the good. The sadness helps us cherish the moments that bring bliss. That even god is the reason we go through things. To make us stronger, or something.. But, what if you never stop feeling sad?Every path brings sadness and happiness. We never really choose what we feel. We could live alone..and still be hollow inside from being lonely. We could surround ourselves with humans, but with the price of betrayal, rejection, anxiety, and loss.I guess what I'm trying to say is..why does death have such a soothing call? Sure, it sounds weak...but, we all die eventually. _PERSON_ never seems to disappear while we are alive..or atleast I feel my depression never does. No matter what happiness is presented, I still feel sad. I get so tired of it. I've tried so many things to get rid of it. Sometimes, it works..but, it always comes back.

750,"edit: skip to the second to last paragraph, the one starting with the word ""first"" if you wish to help but don't want to read the rest of my rant.Just fucking failed my second calc exam, _PERSON_ every other class no problem, but this one is preventing me from doing anything. I may even have to drop to class to not destroy my GPA. My parents are going to freak out on me.But I have 2 exams and a lab report due tomorrow.The thing is that this only applies to the classes I'm taking now, the classes I took last semester were reading and writing intensive. I do poorly (by my own standards). I can't seem to focus to be able to read through an assignment, sometimes finding a video lecture helps, but that isn't always an option. Sometimes the material Is to in depth and specific for what I'm trying to get out of it (like trying to do Calc-based physics and only finding videos pertaining to algebraic physics) An internet Addiction doesn't help much either.I really want to be a doctor,  or PA at the least. Also considering engineering (but with calculus fucking me over, fat chance.) I don't have that great of grades due to a bad first semester. Right now I do some low level work in emergency medicine, working on becoming an EMT. I absolutely love volunteering for that stuff.My parents are some of the smartest idiots I know. I know they really care about me and want what is best for me, but sometimes what is best for me is just really fucked up. I can recall one time that (so my parents knew, but wasn't really the case) that I hadn't had a girlfriend in a while. My best friend at the time was dating this girl. She tried cheating on him with me, my parents found out and thought I should go for it, she even sent me nudes. Needless to say I didn't go for it, and I told him about it. Their advice has meant little to me ever since.I am lucky enough despite being 5'5"" and 250lbs (this one doesn't bother me that much) to find myself an attractive girlfriend. The only problem is that we are on such different intellectual levels. During our senior years of highschool I was 5 years ahead of her math wise. We have little common interest. The thing about this that pisses me off the most is that the crowd she hangs out with an I do. Sometimes I'll ask her to do something and she will flat out refuse. When her friends ask she goes for it and then invites me. Kind of pisses me off that they have more pull than me. She also kind of sort of cheated on me. My friends and I just finished the movie smiley, Which for some reason prompted her to get on omegle, she started talking to a guy on skype. She left herself logged in on my phone, he sent her a message. I went through the history and she referred to me ask her ex. This was on the 4th of July I found out, One year exactly since I met her and 2 days before out 1 year. (fortunatly or not, I couldn't get time off work from McDonalds Night shift so I told her I found out and left for my 10 hour shift.) My parents told me she didn't *really* cheat since it was just some random guy she met online and she didn't do anything physically, and said I should stay with her, well I did. I haven't cared about our relationship much since. I sometimes feel like the only thing driving our relationship is sex. We've been together for 1 year and 8 months.Now that I am in College, I have few friends, We rarely have time to see eachother (well I'm free, they're not) I went most of my first semester friendless, and now my friends just have no time for me. Being generally socially awkward doesn't help much either. I recently tried going to my schools anime club, just to find out I wasn't as into it as they are.This semester I have a room to myself, but last semester I had a roomate. Because I had no friends I knew no one was knocking for me. Nothing pissed me off more than when he wasn't in the room and someone knocked on the door. Every time I said he's not here without opening the door rage soured through me. I had little problem with the experience of having no friends, It was being reminded that hurt. It also doesn't help that I quit playing online video games with my friends because I was too much of a cheap bastard to bother buying a membership. When I got back to my room, I started doing some violent things to myself, I realize or at least hope I can cut my losses and make it through.I would like some help with resources and have various questions on the matter.First, I see that there are plenty of places to call, but I personally loathe phone calls. Is there anything text based resources wise. Some website I can go to, to get paired with a counciler?Second, I found my insurance card, I know my university accepts my insurance, my question is how can I make as little a paper trail to follow as possible, If my parents find out It will only make things worse. (someone once called the cops to do a wellness check on me when I was 13. The result of that was 6 trips to the psychologist and 4 trips to the psychiatrist. Psychologist and I got no where, for the psychiatrist my mother was always in the room and it felt as though he was just prescribing things at her will based on what she thought I had. Despite Good grades in high school one of the first things I got put on was ADHD medication. It only made me upset, my mother wanted me to stay on it because it was supposed to aid in weightloss. Then antidepressents, they made me lack the ability to feel any emotion, it was kind of nice looking back as I was more productive on them. Then the psychiatrist gave me a prescription that was $1000 a bottle, At this point my parents said he was a quack, and that was the end of getting psychological help.) I'm sorry for rambling.

752,"It seems that all I think about is death, and how much I would like to be dead. I don't necessarily think I would kill myself, hence the title, but I'm not quite sure what I am capable of when I am in my ""dark zone,"" as I call it. When I am left to my thoughts my mind is clouded and I feel as if everyone has left the Earth and I remain wondering where everyone went. I think of mainly death and self harm, and other things I don't want to go into detail with. I do have times where I am happy, I laugh and sometimes smile and have good thoughts. But the time between these moments feel like they are infinitely long, and my heart literally feels as if it is going to collapse. And then there are times where I am extremely angry at everyone and everything for no reason, and I know there is no reason but I still feel this hatred. This also leads to dark thoughts but again I don't wish to go into them at this moment. After a rather unpleasant encounter with a group of girls in my old neighborhood I accidentally sent my mom a text that led to me telling her I have social anxiety issues. She sent me to some christian therapist. (Not to mention I was hiding everything else and still do to this day.) That is all I remember of him because that is all it seemed to be advertised. Although I do remember how he liked to talk a lot about himself. He asked me something about my baseball team, I think if I was friends with any of them or something, and I said I rarely talk to them. His response was, well go talk to them. I was there because I said I had social anxiety issues and the first thing he said to me was that he doesn't prescribe medication. At that point I had enough of him and lied to my mom saying that I was all better, a last ditch effort after 3 visits and she believed me. A year later when I got the courage to ask if I could see someone else, I wanted to see a psychiatrist that I choose, she proceeded to yell at me for lying. And that was the end of me ever wanting to seek help from a professional. Especially because I am afraid they will pass information on to my mom that I don't want her knowing.Now that I identify as transgender and atheist I feel I must hide all that I am from my family and most everyone else making things worse. Then in my dark moments I question myself as to what I really think I am making myself extremely confused as to what I really believe. Like am I just identifying as transgender because I really believe it or do I want some bit of attention from those that I do tell. I am going into my senior year of high school with no idea what to do after I graduate, how I will survive in a world that I am deeply afraid of. Now that my mom is pressuring me to move to Arizona I have to choose between a whole new state and surroundings or being left on my own in a way where it would be difficult to live on my own, mainly financially. But if I don't deal with my mom or cut her out of my life soon I feel like she will absolutely drive me to kill myself. Not intentionally but through complete ignorance that hurts me.I feel there is so much wrong with me that I can't quite put into words that amount to the conclusion that everyone is better off with me dead, including myself. I don't know what I was hoping to get out of this. A place to vent, words to keep me going, or something else. I am walking uphill into a fog I can't hope to see through, driven by some force I can't understand but can feel is breaking under my weight.

757,"This is a kinda long story. My fiance and I have been together since nov 2013, and wanted to wait a solid year before we moved in together. Our move in date was May 1st. I am disabled by my mental health (depression, agoraphobia, anxiety- about 10 pills to get through the day and get to sleep), I go to a support group and therapy weekly. When he, my fiance is around I feel safe and able to do more things. This was a big thing for me to look forward to, as a person who hadn't had much to look forwards to.Well he got into some trouble with someone he ought not have had anything to do with because of her age (that happened years before we met). He had been going to one pointless court date after another until the one last Thursday where he got a year probation. He's trying to get his probation transferred from there to here. So now we're fucked, had to let go of the apartment and everything associated.I know this wasn't done to intentionally hurt me. I feel broken. This seems to have pushed me over the edge. I feel like cutting almost all the time. I've even been thinking about taking specific pills in excess. I'm 33 and things haven't gotten better, the last few years they've been getting worse. The only thing that stops me is not knowing what will happen if I die. I've been waiting for things to get better for 30-some years and they just don't. I thought this was my chance at a normal life and at happiness. My kid would be better off with my family. My fiance would be better off with someone who lived near him and with a lot less mental health issues.  I can't do anything, shop, walk around the house without thinking about the fact that we should be picking those out, is he going to help me drive my son (they're close, considering we they only have every few months to see each other) to school.

760,"So most of you are here to find help or here to help others.  I'm actually both.  I've come here to support you all, but by providing that support you guys are helping me deal with these emotions too.  It has been a really crazy and honestly a messed up year for me so far.  On February 19^rd one of my good friends decided to take his life.  This was exactly 6 days after he became an adult.  That's 6 days of living life as a supposed free man.  He had troubles with depression, honestly he was too smart for himself.  He knew what was going on internally and felt there was no escape.There was a way though.  He was very private about his emotions and condition.  I truly feel that if he was open to sharing these thoughts with others, the possibility to cure himself was there.  Everybody I know loved this kid, and we still do, but it hurts that he isn't here in physical form to show that love.Only two weeks later a teen I had little personal connection to committed suicide also.  I had texted him a few times, and he seemed like an extremely happy and wonderful guy.  Yet he hid his true emotions and feelings of despair.  I think about both of these guys almost every day, sometimes many times a day.So I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you feel like there is no way out, take a minute to find someone to talk to.  Don't be scared about how people will see these emotions.  I challenge each and everyone of you on this subreddit to tell one person how you feel about them or even what is on your mind.

763,"Hello, I'm in my early 20's and just going through another self loathing period. I'm use to it, it's happened before, and I don't see it being out of my life any time soon. In my most recent period of being down, I had reoccurring thoughts of suicide. Now, when I say this, I mean it in a sense that I believe many of us actually think about it. What would it mean if I killed myself, would it be worth it, how would it affect my loved ones etc. Now, I've been having these thoughts, and I feel okay with them. I've come close to acting out on them before, but not recently. However, the problem I see is that I can't really think of talking to someone about my thoughts of suicide, just based on what people initially think. They will think that I need immediate help (which is thoughtful), but I feel as though just talking about it would be some sort of therapy in itself, something to help relieve myself. Yet, I really do think people commonly have thoughts of suicide. For me at least, it's a common thought process which so far has always lead to the same conclusion, it's not worth it. Also, I here people say that certain reasons are not ""good"" ones to commit suicide. Yet from what I understand, it's totally subjective. My upbringing/biology/current environmental factors together create a unique thought process and experiences, in which I feel that suicide would be the best option.Two questions than:1) Do you believe that general thoughts of suicide as I described are common amongst the general _PERSON_) Do you feel right judging the reasons for oneself to commit suicide? (Can you say with confidence that one's reasons may be ""nonsense""?""Not sure if this post is going to do much, but I just find getting my thoughts out to be relief enough.

764,"This is going to be a long post, if you don't care to read it, then pass on by, that's understandable. I want you to know that, while at this very moment I am not sitting here with any immediate intention to kill myself, I must confess that the idea has been on my mind almost every moment of my life for the greater part of a decade, but has become worse in the last five or six. There are things about me that I have never shared with anyone, not my friends, family, therapist, clergyman or anyone, anywhere, for any reason. Lately, I have cared less and less about continuing a life of futility. I have a knee injury that has never healed properly and I am left in constant pain that feels like there is glass in my knee. At no moment of a day am I not in so much pain that it is on my mind. My prescription of _PERSON_ offers no relief at all, much to my dismay. I have lived with this pain now for over a year and have seen medical professionals who passed it off as me just trying to avoid work.In addition to that, I have COPD and have a hard time getting out and doing anything, so between the two, I have effectively become a shut in. My family believes I exaggerate the pain in my knee and the troubles that come with COPD to avoid work.Admittedly, I am a lazy person, but I actually enjoy work. I enjoy the feeling of completing something. So, when I am not longer able to do things as simple as walking my dog, depression starts to kick in...something no one has noticed after over a year. My family and friends don't recognize my depression because I always put a smile on because I don't want them to worry about me, because then I'd feel guilty.But all of that, I think I could live with and be okay. It's what has been with me for as long as I can remember (around 6 or so). In 28 years on this planet, I have never told anyone in detail about what goes on in my head every day, all day and has shaped almost every decision I have ever made in my adult life. For the record, I am a pacifist and do not condone violence for any reason, but that is where the problem lies. I act and believe in pacifism, but I am not at peace.Every moment, of every day for almost my entire life, I love the idea of rape, murder, torture and straight up just mutilating people. I spend all day thinking about it and how to do it the best way. There are no exceptions, children, elderly, women, men, transgender, anyone and everyone. I want everyone to suffer and feel pain, agony and fear. At the same time, I want people to be happy and safe. I do more for others than I do for myself. I buy other people things with my money and rarely spend on myself. I am always there to help anyone I see in need. However, while I do it, I think of the best way to kill them or whatever else.I am so, so tired of living with this in my head. It is exhausting and I am so ashamed of it that I am afraid to tell my family about it. Everyone thinks I make things up for whatever reason, so if they don't believe me over the physically evident things like my _PERSON_ or COPD, why would they ever believe me about this?  I had found ways to help calm the thoughts down, but they are either really bad outs or not sustainable. Marijuana, I have found, is a catch all remedy. It helps with the knee pain, it is used to help with COPD and also just mellows out the thoughts in my head, but it is quite expensive. Alcohol would lead to a dangerous addiction that has taken my father and both grandfathers, so I refuse to go that route. The only other thing that helped was Cigarettes...and well, COPD, so I had to quit. This made everything worse.So, here I am, sitting here again wondering why I should keep trying to deal with all of this. I no longer have insurance and when I tried to speak of my issues with a therapist before, she dropped me as a client before we could really get into any of it.I don't want to upset my family by killing myself, which I think is the only reason I haven't. I am truly afraid, I think, that there will be a trigger where I am no longer concerned with keeping my thoughts in and instead they become actions. I am afraid of the person I may become and for that reason I ask...Why should I bother sticking around, in pain, waiting for the day where I say fuck it and let loose on those around me and am remembered only as a headline?TL;DR: There isn't one.",1,23,855,long post care read pass understandable moment sitting intention kill confess idea mind moment life greater part decade worse things shared friends family therapist clergyman reason cared continuing life futility knee injury healed properly left constant pain feels glass knee moment day pain mind prescription person offers relief dismay lived pain year medical professionals passed avoid work addition copd hard time effectively shut family believes exaggerate pain knee troubles copd avoid work admittedly lazy person enjoy work enjoy feeling completing longer things simple walking dog depression starts kick noticed year family friends recognize depression put smile worry feel guilty live long remember years planet told detail head day day shaped decision made adult life record pacifist condone violence reason problem lies act pacifism peace moment day entire life love idea rape murder torture straight mutilating people spend day thinking exceptions children elderly women men transgender suffer feel pain agony fear time people happy safe buy people things money rarely spend kill tired living head exhausting ashamed afraid family thinks make things reason physically evident things person copd found ways calm thoughts bad outs sustainable marijuana found catch remedy helps knee pain copd mellows thoughts head expensive alcohol lead dangerous addiction father grandfathers refuse route thing helped cigarettes copd quit made worse sitting wondering deal longer insurance speak issues therapist dropped client upset family killing reason haven afraid trigger longer concerned keeping thoughts actions afraid person reason bother sticking pain waiting day fuck loose remembered headline tl dr,28.0,46.0,16,17,6,32,14,29,7,17
765,"Hi everyone, it's my first time posting here. I hope i'm posting in the right place. I am in a really delicate and uncomfortable situation and would love some advice from someone who's experienced or dealt with this before.First, a bit of background. I have an old friend that I was kind to in high-school, because he didn't really have anyone (there were some rumors...i didn't take them seriously, and didn't think it was fair. So I decided to try and reach out). Because of that, He kind of latched on to me and has always referred to me as his best friend. I haven't seen him in about 8 years.  About 2 years ago he had some legal troubles (drugs). Which were then exacerbated when he fell asleep with a girl at a party. I assume they were both on drugs, but I'm told they both awoke with all of their clothes on, and he wasn't aware of any impropriety. unfortunately, the young woman told the university that he had sexually assaulted her. Long story short, he didn't have the resources to fight it (his parents died a couple years ago), and he went to jail for about 9 months. While he was in jail, i'd get the occasional letter that I would respond to (not wanting to be a jerk...we have some things in common, so I would humor him and we'd exchange fiction  and poetry we'd been working on to help him pass the time.) Now he's out and trying to pull his life back together, with no money, no family, and a prized spot on a sex offender registry.Which brings me to today.....I pull into work and get  a text that he's thinking about suicide. I have to go to a meeting in a few, but  as a ""Friend"" and a human I need to try to talk him out of it. I told him I had to go to a meeting and I'd give him a call on my lunch-break, does anyone have any advice on what I should actually say?additional background if necessary: Friend is in Narcanon, is not religious at all, is highly intelligent, and really really hates what he refers to as ""touchy feely, 12 step bullshit"" at NA.",0,6,381,time posting hope posting place delicate uncomfortable situation love advice experienced dealt bit background friend kind high school rumors fair decided reach kind latched referred friend years years ago legal troubles drugs exacerbated fell asleep girl party assume drugs told awoke clothes aware impropriety young woman told university sexually assaulted long story short resources fight parents died couple years ago jail months jail occasional letter respond wanting jerk things common humor exchange fiction poetry working pass time pull life back money family prized spot sex offender registry brings today pull work text thinking suicide meeting friend human talk told meeting give call lunch break advice additional background friend narcanon religious highly intelligent hates refers touchy feely step bullshit na,22.0,10.0,6,9,1,5,12,7,6,18

779,"So I'm 21 years old and I feel like my life is shit. I grew up with a mentally ill mother who told me all if her life's horror stories before I made it out of elementary school. Horror stories that include her being beaten, raped, homeless. I even walked in on her trying to hurt herself once. She spent some time in and out of mental hospitals while I was real young. I spent a good portion of my life trying to keep her happy so I wouldn't lose her. I've grown detached and resentful towards her.When I was in middle school, I was bullied. Girls would ribbet at me and call me froggy. In the 8th grade, I started smoking pot. In 9th grade I was molested by my ""ex boyfriend"" that I had dated the year before. I say it in quotations because we were only together a few weeks. My longest relationship was when I was 13. I dated a 17 yr old. We dated three weeks. In high school, a bunch of my friends continued to hang out with the ex that molested me and eventually I got to the point where I resented them so much for it that I lost comfort with them. In fact I'm finding that even now I feel uncomfortable around those closest to me. I thought when I went to college things would get better but they didn't. The day my dad took me to move into the dorms, he had to wake up extra early to take my younger brother to the mental hospital. I was so upset about it, I opted out of all the hall bonding activities. Not long after my brother got out, he started running away constantly. Meanwhile, I was having trouble adjusting. Most days I didn't go to class, I would just sleep all day and only leave the room to eat at the dining hall. I almost failed out second semester, but was given a second chance which I screwed away. I started drinking. Got so trashed a couple times that police were involved. I just wanted to be like everybody else who was partying and having fun and enjoying college. I felt like an outcast like I always had. The school finally told me I either had to go to drug and alcohol treatment or I couldn't come back, so I went to treatment. I should mention I was also on several medications for depression and anxiety while I was in school. They tried adjusting my meds and giving me new ones, but it only made things worse. I would just get manic. While I was in drug counseling, I decided to go off meds all together. I was completely clean and sober for maybe a month. I had two months no drugs or alcohol. I hated treatment. I hated going to aa meetings three times a week and being told I was an addict in denial. Eventually the program I was in released me with a neutral discharge because I refused to accept my diagnosis as an addict/alcoholic. School tried to refuse my re-entry, but due to semantics they couldn't actually kick me out. They did, however, hold me out of classes to the point I was so behind that I would never catch up when I was working and babysitting at the same time. I worked my way up from driver to assistant manager at the pizza place I worked after 6 months. I was drinking a lot less cuz after being clean and sober, I had trouble stomaching liquor. The place I worked at was awful. I saw 5 managers go in and out in the year I was there. The store was poorly managed and unorganized. I tried as an assistant but eventually gave up. It wasn't worth the effort when the people under me made more than I did. A car accident left we with back, neck, and shoulder pain that made work more difficult. I was accused of being lazy because I didn't over exert myself. Meanwhile I was the most reliable person there. Anytime any one called out or the store was in trouble I was there to save the day even before I was management. Now I'm working at another fast food place where I'm on my feet for 8 hours with a bad back. I'm one of two new managers and we both suck. We've both been there a month. The new job stresses me out. I work six days a week and I work weird hours so I barely see my friends. My brothers in jail. My sister is about to have my niece put in foster care because they can't deal with each other anymore. To top it all off my grandmother and my great aunt who was the closest thing I had to a grandmother on my moms side both just died. My grandmother a couple months ago, my aunt a couple days ago. I also just ""broke up"" with a guy I wasn't really dating. We just spent almost every day together. I fed him, bought him cigarettes, we smoked a good bit of money, I drove him around. I have bruises on my leg from where he hit me with his favorite piece while we were play fighting. I keep thinking I should kill myself, but I don't want to do that to my family and friends because I know there are people who love me. I also do have the smallest shred of hope that things will all work out, but I'm miserable. It's only a matter of time before I get fired from this job. I've already called out three times in the month I've been there. Once I was too depressed to go in, the next day I was too hung over and then my aunt died a few weeks later. I think I should just do like everybody else in my family and spend some time in the mental hospital to sort myself out, but I'm scared that will freak everybody out too. Plus it obviously didn't help my brother or really my mom either. I don't know what to do anymore. I can barely eat or sleep. I lost 20 lbs in a month and while I needed to lose weight, I didn't do it the healthy way. I lost weight from not eating/barely eating and getting drunk and throwing up all day. I keep waking up with anxiety attacks where it feels like my skin is crawling. I'm falling apart. I've even thought about doing hard drugs cuz why not? If everything's going to shit whether I'm trying to do the right thing or not then why shouldn't I go out with a bang? Party hard and speed up the dying process. Fuck it. My best friend from high school got real bad into drugs. I thought I was in love with her too. Thought I was in love with another junkie after her too. Nope I'm not in love with anyone. You're either someone to take care of or someone to take care of me and I don't feel comfortable around the people who try to take care of me anymore. I don't really feel close to anyone anymore. I'm lookin at a life where I'm only gonna get crazier. I just wanna give up.

780,"Hello, and thank you for reading. I have never been inflicted with such an intense hopelessness in my life. I ordered acoustic foam, and after unsealing the air-tight packaging, a virulent smell came out. I began to worry that it would affect my cognitive skills, and I feel that it already has and is continuing to do so. I suddenly acquired a headache, I became nauseous, and I also started to feel very exhausted. I immediately fell onto my bed and went to sleep, with the toxic panels still in the room. I woke up, and here I am, still dizzy and nauseous, with a headache. Unless I throw them out, I am unable to place them outside of my room. I am stuck with them, and they are eating away at my brain, causing irreversible brain damage.

These were not far off, either, as I had been working tirelessly on them. I can't believe that acoustic foam is going to destroy all of that.

He said I was his last friend. After a bit more discussion, he said that I kind of annoyed him, and he wanted me to sit inside. A friend of mine told me to show him that I would care if he died, but I am not entirely sure how, especially since he doesn't seem to want to be my friend anymore (he unfriended me on Facebook, too, as frivolous as that may sound). I'm not sure what to do, and I'm afraid of telling someone, because everything might end up being fine, but I'm terrified that I'll end up not saying anything, and he'll kill himself. EDIT: He's been isolating himself from everyone, too. This year, he's been really, really antisocial in general. EDIT 2: Earlier this year, he mentioned wanting to actually do stuff with other people (as in, hang out and other social activities). But he said he was too socially awkward, and didn't have enough friends. Today I asked him if he would still attend Doctor _PERSON_ (an after school club, which another friend and I are trying to restart), and he said no. He's changed his mind about wanting to do stuff with other people, apparently, and just sits around watching anime all the time.",0,8,266,day day school year sat friend lunch ve years abnormally sad days normal today asked sit told friend friend bit discussion kind annoyed wanted sit inside friend mine told show care died friend anymore unfriended facebook frivolous sound afraid telling end fine terrified end kill edit isolating year antisocial general edit earlier year mentioned wanting stuff people hang social activities socially awkward friends today asked attend doctor person school club friend restart changed mind wanting stuff people apparently sits watching anime time,10.0,6.0,1,1,1,3,7,4,0,12

I pass out really easily, my parents don't like me, my family is just messed up, I have too many health problems, I can't succeed in killing myself, and so many other things. I don't mean to be selfish when I say I wish I had that group of people. I just mean. Here's an example: I have had issues with hydration for years and heat problems. I pass out or get close to it really often. Recently another girl at school in similar classes has developed a similar thing. Everyone cares about her. Everyone. She's an awesome girl. I'm not saying anything bad about her. But no one notices mine or cares. The few people that notice that I care for and help them when tHings get bad, theyve never done that for me. I wish I was worth that much to someone. My family just loves telling me I'm shit then half heartedly pretending to be supportive.  Or whenever I work, every costumer in the room acknowledges any other employee but me. If I've been cleaning for an hour, barely able to stand up (I have minor scoliosis. Not complaining but it makes things where you bend over harder. ) and another employee comes out, they'll compliment how great they're doing and ignore me. Last summer I would try to talk to people I know online. They'd ignore me. Some would say hi first then after like two messages decide I'm not worth talking to. Why doesn't anyone care about me? I feel selfish wanting that but everyone seems to have it but me. I guess in reality if I had close friends that cared and they tried to intervene and talk to me about what's going on I'd just start hyperventilating and freaking out.

I don't think I'm great alright? But I used to know I was good. I'm trained in dance, vocal, acting, and I came from an arts school. But they all treat me like shit. I fucking hate them. I never tell them that of course though. I just have dreams all the time about finally being in a production again, then I wake up and it's all gone. Everything is gone. I'll never have it again. I'll never get to work with people and entertain the audience. I'm apparently good enough to be exploited for solos but I can't have even an ensemble part in a fucking show. I have tons of experience. I'm suicidal. I'm depressed. I'm anxious. I go for weeks without sleep on end. The only thing I still like, out of music, guitar, violin, piano, singing, etc is theatre.

No one understands how much I miss entertaining everyone on stage. But I can never have it again. Every community theatre is some how fucking attached to people at that damn school. I've auditioned a million times for everything. The theatre class at school was terrible to me. I'm fine with critiques y'know, or I wouldn't enjoy theatre. But the top kids in the class ridiculed me daily and the teacher supported it. This is my LIFE. This is everything to me.  My parents are emotionally abusive and treat me terribly all the time. I can't get a job because I have scoliosis and most minimum wage jobs require bending. I can barely drive because of my back. My parents took away my lessons with my favorite teacher, whose like a father to me, and keep refusing to give them back. I feel like I make my boyfriend buy things constantly like food.

802,"My story is a long one. As far as I remember, it began when I was 4 years old. Although it's not a true start of it. It's only when I got cautious about it. It started, when I was born.As far as my memories reach, I was never able to find friends. Of course I was communicating with other children in kindergarden, but I noticed that others are building some stronger friendships, while I was only aimlessly talking to others. They thought I was strange. Bullied me. I only got an opportunities to talk more with people I wanted to, when theirs friends were not present. It was years of sadness, of lonelyness.Parents and my relatives always said I was pessimistic, tried to cheer me up. But they didn't understand what I really needed.Christmas then was, and still is, a celebration I hate the most. My parents were always saying that Santa can bring me anything I wanted. But they were lieing. Cause I needed a friend, a person who wouldn't bully me, who enjoyed talking with me.Years have passed, I started attending a school. But besides that, nothing was changing. Yes, I met new people here. But they were the same shadows of the past, haunting me with their bad words. People were either ignoring me as a person, or bullying me. They only wanted good for themselves, ignoring my feelings and needs. I failed to find friends here too. I was a freak, listening to ""funeral music"", as they called it.Even when I actually thought I found a suitable person, possible friend, they berrayed me. Joined those who hated me. Then I started regretting trying to find friends and thought it would be better just to be alone. But it led to even darker times. I started thinking about suicide, always used an opportunity to cause pain to myself. It helped me to relief from the pain I suffered inside. Although I knew that in reality it changed nothing.And now, I'm in the last, 12th grade. And everything's the same. I have no friends, if I make any they leave me  really quickly. I'm bound to be alone. And it's too difficult for me.

I have been depressed, ADHD, bi-polar, or just mentally ill for a few years now but no matter what I was feeling or thinking ONE person understood and didn't ignore me even after I started cutting.  When I asked for help from my family (who claimed they would understand and do anything to help me) I was met with denial and dismissal. I told my father that “I'm mentally ill”  he refused to believe it and told me to stop worrying and that it's all in my head. In middle school I told my grandmother the only reason I didn't kill myself was because of what would happen to them, and this was after I told her cut myself.	The only person why tried to get me help was my loving mother. I told her I had anxiety and she scheduled me for a doctors appointment the following week. I was put on beta-blockers and re-assessed the next week, at the time they were working great. Too bad the next week the side effects kicked in, horrible and vivid dreams, fainting, head rushes, shortness of breath, faint heart beat, and the list goes on. Then I got counseling except I didn't like it and he ignored what was obviously in front of him. So fuck the medical system I have no faith as even they left me behind and forgot about me.

815,"Hi. My name is _PERSON_ and I am 15 years old. I live in a peaceful town of Aurora OH with my dad and step mom. When I was young, my parents got divorced. This damaged me internally. I now almost never get to see my mom. I have been living with my dad for the past 11 years. My dad is diagnosed with a mental problem called bipolar. This has been affecting me TREMENDOUSLY as he goes from one mood to another within a matter of minutes. My step mom is nice sometimes but she doesn't like a lot. My dad is tired of my of what I do. I love computers. I worship them. I have made my own computer and have made it for gaming. I spend my own money on upgrading my rig and also buying and playing games. I love learning about technology and all about it. But unfortunately... that's the only thing I like doing. I don;t do anything else. I have attempted to try other stuff. It just ever works out. I am socially awkward as it is very hard to make friends. I hate talking to other people and I am very shy. My dad doesn't like me spending time with technology. He wants me to become like every other student. Play sports, have friends, and do well in school. I am not either of those. I hate physical education and not good. I don't have a lot of friends neither do I like talking to people. I get C's,D's, and F's in school. This year was my first year of high school. My first year in a public school. I am a christian and totally dedicated to the thought of heaven. This first year of highschool was the worst year of my life. I have kids all around me that smoke, do drugs, curse, and more. I don't get bullied which is good. Maybe it's because of my long hair :P The thing that gets to me is work. I HATE working. I have 0 motivation what. so. ever. to do anything. When it ranges from physical work or school work. I try to think that I can do it and do well in school but I can't. My teachers are mean and they don't teach well. There is just so much work that I can't handle it anymore. I get stressed and frustrated very easily. I try to mention some of my feelings about school to my parents but they are not doing anything about it. They think it is some kind of joke. They don't take it seriously. I want to find a way to motivate my self to do well in school but I can't. There is nothing to motivate me. My parents yell at me and yell and yell and that is all they do. They think that is the way to motivate me. So does my teachers. I like to be alone with my electronics as this calms me down. I listen to music to calm me down as well. I also live with a brother that has anxiety, anger issues, and bipolar. He makes friends better then me. In fact, he is all of those things that I am not. He always does better in school. Straight A's. I don't know how he does it. I feel like school is a waste of time. I feel like teachers and parents don't know what its like if they were us. Teachers are supposed to help students do better and find a way to motivate the students. Like I said, I and no one else has found a way to motivate me. I feel like school is not teaching you to become smart but everything is based on memory. I am totally against the idea of school. Everything about it. But it just gets to me. I am depressed in school. I don't talk, don't listen, get yelled at. I hate it and no one is doing anything to change it. I have been getting suicide thoughts since fall. They are becoming more frequent. They were monthly, then weekly, and now they are almost daily. I am depressed more frequently. I sometimes like to listen to Chill music and look at beautiful landscapes and say to myself, ""Will I ever achieve anything? Will I ever make it? Will I..... be alive in a year?"".  You guys are probably asking, you are killing yourself because of school and family in the summer? Yes it is summer and it is much more relieving. I have countless hours in my room spending time on my computer. This is probably all I do. I love it and enjoy it with a passion. My parents HATE IT SO MUCH. We were at the dinner table talking about regular things until school came up. I mentioned to them that this is summer and not school. It's a break from school. They dont care what I say when its making choices for myself. My parents have forced me to play piano, soccer, karate, drama etc... I have quit all of them. I have never had a normal conversation with my dad or my step mom. Like literally. Never. Not even joking. They all end up with yelling at me. Just tonight did they yell at me again. I tend to back talk a lot which is not good. But I have no way of defending my self. They think all I do is play games. Not true. But they don't believe me! They hate what I do with my life and that I should try other things! Like I said. I hate everything else. Just tonight they decided to wake me up every morning at 7 to study. I thought the work was done you know? I was so happy. I was not depressed as much. But this is gonna kill me. Literally. My parents hate me and I never get to see my mom a lot. But when I do, I love to stay with her. I want to live with her. But now that this is happening. I can't take it anymore. This isn't the first time my parents are fed up with me about school. This year I couldn't go to a family reunion with my mom to Florida because of my grades. I really wanted to go and tried SOOOO hard in school. But my grades didn't go up. They went down. I sit down and think about what i'll be when I grow up. I don't see anything good or anything at all. I don't know what to do with my future. I don't think i'll be living by the time I am 20. I hate this society SOOO DAMN much. No one cares about anyone! NO ONE! Were ALL EQUAL you know?! ug! I am so unsuccessful I can't take it anymore and I can't take any more actions. I give up with my life. SO much work and no love and compassion to me. I cry every freaking single day by myself. I want to kill my self. I want to kill myself in the future. I don't know when or how. I have no plans or way but I want to. I just need to stop this before I take action. I hate my life and want to end it soon.",1,11,1236,person years live peaceful town aurora dad step mom young parents divorced damaged internally mom living dad past years dad diagnosed mental problem called bipolar affecting tremendously mood matter minutes step mom nice lot dad tired love computers worship made computer made gaming spend money upgrading rig buying playing games love learning technology thing don attempted stuff works socially awkward hard make friends hate talking people shy dad spending time technology student play sports friends school hate physical education good lot friends talking people school year year high school year public school christian totally dedicated thought heaven year highschool worst year life kids smoke drugs curse bullied good long hair thing work hate working motivation ranges physical work school work school teachers teach work handle anymore stressed frustrated easily mention feelings school parents kind joke find motivate school motivate parents yell yell yell motivate teachers electronics calms listen music calm live brother anxiety anger issues bipolar makes friends fact things school straight feel school waste time feel teachers parents teachers supposed students find motivate students found motivate feel school teaching smart based memory totally idea school depressed school talk listen yelled hate change suicide thoughts fall frequent monthly weekly daily depressed frequently listen chill music beautiful landscapes achieve make alive year guys killing school family summer summer relieving countless hours room spending time computer love enjoy passion parents hate dinner table talking regular things school mentioned summer school break school nt care making choices parents forced play piano soccer karate drama quit normal conversation dad step mom literally joking end yelling tonight yell tend back talk lot good defending play games true hate life things hate tonight decided wake morning study thought work happy depressed gon na kill literally parents hate mom lot love stay live happening anymore time parents fed school year family reunion mom florida grades wanted hard school grades sit grow good future living time hate society sooo damn cares equal ug unsuccessful anymore actions give life work love compassion cry freaking single day kill kill future plans stop action hate life end,43.0,36.0,25,25,13,29,25,26,13,38

821,I've got twenty three days clean today and my life is s*** . I was working earlier at my grandparents they pay me some money to come over four times a week and cook and clean for them. &amp; I started 2 have an anxiety attack out of nowhere. This voice in my head telling me I'll never be good enough everything I do is pointless and that I'm a worthless piece of s*** . Maybe voice is the wrong way to describe it its just this recurring thought that no matter what I do it's never enough. I had just been cleaning my grandma's room and she's got prescription pills in there they both have pills that I've stolen in the past and gotten high off of. And when I was freaking out I won't lie I thought about going to go get some and using them. I know this is the reason that I started using drugs in the first place to escape my feelings of worthlessness. Everyone around me sees a happy smiling strong person and I'm on the inside screaming wondering why nobody can see my pain and knowing that I can never show them because it would overwhelm them. I've been going to group meetings and talking about the changes in my life now that I'm clean and it helps but these feeling still come. Facing my reality I'm constantly suicidal lately. I had to cut my dad out of my life yesterday because him and his girlfriend refuse to support me in my efforts to get clean and they think its okay to smoke weed in front of me when I come over to visit them. My dad has also never been around for me in my life growing up due to his own mental problems and difficulties dealing with life. I've built up the relationship that we have in the past few years but I always hold back how I really feel which is resentment and anger that he was never the dad he was supposed to be. So yesterday I finally got all of it out and told him how I felt and told him that his anger has stolen my voice more than once because I was scared to tell him my real opinion. My mom is no help she is shacked up with my ex boyfriend. Completely emotionally un supportive and never willing to stand up for herself or me she always has been. Also a control freak . I keep telling myself to just keep pushing forward and it will be better. I'm going to save up and get an apartment I'm going to get another job so I can do this more quickly and yet the voice in my head is holding me back. Its telling me that I can't handle another job that I'll never get out of this place that I'm doomed to just be a failure for ever and I might as well end it. I'm so scared that I'm going to fail I don't even want to try anymore. Being raised by my mom she made me feel like I had to be perfect all the time and I could never f****** measure up. Even though she's fat and ugly and has no room to make anyone else feel bad about themselves I always loved her and trusted her and I just believed everything that she said and I believed that I could never be good enough. Now I see how she really is and I just want to die my life is been one big f****** joke. Always with self doubt and failure ruling my life. I let her control me and dominate my life and it was all because I was too scared to just defy the one person who had never left me and stand on my own two feet. I was a scared and weak person and I still am.,1,9,660,twenty days clean today life working earlier grandparents pay money times week cook clean amp started anxiety attack voice head telling good pointless worthless piece voice wrong describe recurring thought matter cleaning grandma room prescription pills pills stolen past high freaking lie thought reason started drugs place escape feelings worthlessness sees happy smiling strong person inside screaming wondering pain knowing show overwhelm group meetings talking life clean helps feeling facing reality constantly suicidal cut dad life yesterday girlfriend refuse support efforts clean smoke weed front visit dad life growing due mental problems difficulties dealing life built relationship past years hold back feel resentment anger dad supposed yesterday finally told felt told anger stolen voice scared real opinion mom shacked boyfriend completely emotionally supportive stand control freak telling pushing forward save apartment job quickly voice head holding back telling handle job place doomed failure end scared fail anymore raised mom made feel perfect time measure fat ugly room make feel bad loved trusted believed believed good die life big joke doubt failure ruling life control dominate life scared defy person left stand feet scared weak person,26.0,30.0,16,13,12,15,14,17,6,20

824,"About 2 years ago I inherited a large sum of money from the death of my father.  I do have pre existing mental health issues (Level I Bipolar Disorder) which I am medicated for.  When I inherited this money, the only people in this world who I considered friends wanted to go into business with me.  They kept asking me for money for this and that ""for the restaurant""  they both held and still hold management positions at other restaurants.  I kept giving them money trusting people who I had known for years not to cheat me.  One then moved in with me without paying rent with a girlfriend and they got drunk and fought all the time and made it a very difficult place for me to live.  I eventually put my foot down and told them to pay their share or get out since my friends name was then on the lease too.  His solution was to call up a friend of his who I did not know who was a white supremacist who came over with two of his friends held a gun to my head and took all my valuables.  The police thought I was making the story up because I am mentally ill and that is what all my so called friends told them.  And my roommate talked to the apartment manager and had me kicked out since I now couldn't pay rent and he mysteriously came up with his share and my share for his girlfriend to take over the lease.  These skinheads kept following me around for a few days and scaring me, and one day I come outside to my car having been stripped.  This set me into overload and I checked myself into the hospital just to insure I was in a safe place for a little while if nothing else.  I was eventually able to move away to my mothers in another town in order to get away from all this but out here has not been without its own challenges and dramas.  This chapter I will make short and say I slept with a woman who I went to high school with, could not rise to the occasion after a few seconds and it ended.  She then wound up pregnant, and has told everyone we went to high school with that I impregnated her and abandoned her without taking any responsibility.  Her own family has told me she was sleeping with two married men while she was with me (our relationship lasted a month and we had only tried to sleep together that once) and her brother lives across the street from my new house and she camps out there all day long every day to torment me I feel.  All of these events I feel would drive someone who has sound mental health over the edge but I have tried to endure and some days are easier than others.  I am just getting tired of living in a world where the people who you should be able to trust are the ones who end up sticking knife after knife in you for no other point than to watch you bleed.  So here I am, a 33 year old guy who has never married and lives at home with my mom, I have no job or car and I live in fear of the outside world which I once loved to be a part of so much because so many people have successfully hurt me and I am just too tired to fight anymore and don't want to really dust myself off and keep trying again.

837,"I tried to kill myself a few months back, basically to avoid being a burden on society because I can't do anything right. I was in the psych ward for a week. I got out. I'm supposed to be better now, and for a while I was, with the exception of an apathetic outlook on life.A few weeks ago, our door got stuck shut when my cat was outside. I could have gone out through the garage to get him, but I was tired and not the most logical, so I opened the window that was next to the door and tried to lift the screen out. It wouldn't come out, so I forced it out and bent the frame in the process. Now it's unusable.My mom said she wasn't mad, but told me to be more conscientious next time. She was frustrated though, but seemed quick to forgive me for acting rashly.Today I told her about how our cat couldn't figure out which door to use when I called him in, even though he could see me, sort of as a humorous anecdote I guess because our cat is really dumb. But she started going on about how she was irritated that I was acting thoughtlessly and cost her a screen, and that she didn't know where to get one and how I never have to accept consequences for my actions because I'm not a responsible adult. I told her I was really tired and not thinking clearly. She told me, ""Sometimes you have to think clearly.""She asked me to load the dishwasher and went upstairs. Well of course during this time all I had to think about was what a fuck up I am, and kept imaging vivid images of my arms covered in cuts and bleeding profusely because that's just what I think about when I feel guilty. She came downstairs and asked me if I had any plans today, but I couldn't answer because I was trying not to cry. Then she figured that I was upset, and asked me why. After a long pause I told her that I didn't know she was still upset about the screen.Then she told me about how she had taken years to learn mindfulness, and it just drove her crazy that she had to see all these people go around and make stupid decisions without even thinking. After ranting for a bit, she said she was furious that I went back to my dad's, even after she'd given me this opportunity to have a better life. I couldn't tell if she meant the last time I lived with him or a few days ago when I didn't feel well and stayed with him because my appointment was near his house and I didn't feel like driving back (would have been an hour drive), but I didn't ask.Then she went on about how until I learned to do things for myself, I'd be a burden, either on her or society. She said it takes a lot of practice to be that mindful and to realize what the right choices are, but that every time I get close I just ""throw it all away"" because I want to be a victim or something. She again referred to me choosing to live with my dad (he's controlling and abusive). She mentioned how I can't stay in school and that I'll probably fail the next time I try because I haven't improved.I don't know if this is her odd way of motivating me. She said I should use these criticisms to realize what's going on and work hard to change. But I've been in therapy since getting out of the hospital to do just that. I thought I was working on changing.She said she was irritated about the window, but that it wasn't about the window. She asked if I could accept why she was upset. I didn't answer.The whole time it just made sense to me that I'm a fuck up and she thought of me as a burden. Everyone probably does. I tried to kill myself before because whenever I tried to change that, whether that be by holding down a job or going to school, I failed or was completely miserable. So I could be miserable not being a burden or make other people miserable by being a burden, which would also make me miserable, or I could just kill myself now and spare everyone and myself all the misery.I don't know why I'm writing this, other than to just get my thoughts out there. Or maybe there's another solution and I just haven't thought of it because I'm just a thoughtless zombie burden. I'm not sure.

838,"I don't know where else to post this. I'm in the biggest shithole predicament of my life up to this point, and I feel as if I have no way out. I was recently arrested (about four months ago) for two felony drug possession charges. My house was raided because my roommate, unbeknownst to me, was selling drugs out of our house and ended up selling to an undercover. One day, I answered to a knock on the door to a gun in my face, and all of a sudden dozens of cops started running into my house. They had a warrant to search the entire premises. During that time, I had anti-anxiety medicine (not prescribed to me) in my possession, as well as weed, safely kept in my bedroom. The police searched my room, found the drugs, and arrested me.I was in school to become a teacher. I was student teaching during the time of the arrest. My students were everything to me, the particular group of eighth graders I was student teaching at the time confirmed my decision to be a teacher. I was making straight A's, finally feeling happy and fulfilled with my life, and knowing this is what I wanted to do. I would occasionally take a half of one of the anti-anxiety meds before teaching to lower my heartbeat and feelings of nervousness, hence the reason I had them. I tried going to therapy, but the doctors I saw never helped me and I just couldn't talk to them. I have a hard time talking to anyone. I would come home, do my homework, and smoke a few bowls once I was finished with all of my work to relax, and as a reward at the end of the day. I enjoyed it, and I didn't see anything wrong with it. I never partied, or brought the drugs out of my house. I am a very introverted person, and almost always kept to myself. Teaching was one of the ways I always felt would help me get over my extreme social anxiety issues. In the few months following the arrest, I was not able to return to student teaching, which means all of my former students were basically under the impression that I ditched them. I had to change my major, and move out of my house. I lost the few friends I did have due to my depressive, introverted personality. I currently live with my boyfriend, who is incredibly supportive. My parents are disappointed in me. All I ever wanted to do was make them proud, help people, and just be happy with my life. I feel as if I have lost almost everything that meant anything to me.I finally am facing the fact that I might actually do time in jail. I have a good lawyer, but after doing extensive research through my lawyer and the internet, I found out this particular District Attorney and judge(s) almost always sentence people with felony drug possession charges in my area to jail time. I would honestly rather die than have to spend any time in jail.All I wanted to do in this world was live a life helping people, and trying to be happy. The fact that I might have to go to jail, postpone my life for years to come, and become a convicted felon is driving me back into a downward spiral. I am not a bad person. I have never stolen anything in my life, and I have never hurt a fly. I don't understand what I did to deserve this. I have considered suicide in the past, but never as much as I have now. I feel as if society and the world in general doesn't want me here. I have already planned my suicide entirely, as well as when I will do this. I don't really know if anybody will even read this. I just need somebody, anybody, to hear me. Give me your opinions if you choose, I am willing to accept anything anyone wants to say.

839,"I have depression. I haven't been diagnosed, mostly because my parents refuse to take me, but it's hard to talk to people and I cry every night about how lonely I feel, so I guess I'm depressed.Anyway, the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because of a girl in my theater class. She's always noticed when I feel like shit, and she always came to talk to me about it. It felt like she cared more about me than anyone else in my life, and it also helped that she was really pretty.I'm in love with her. She has a boyfriend, and he's great, and they have a great relationship, but I still love her. I would be dead without her, so I feel like I owe her my life. With many girls in my school, I say I want to date them, but she's different. I know that I would die for her if I had to.Now that I've graduated, and she lives in a different city, I know I'll never see her again. I've been told to move on, but I can't. With her, I know what it's like when someone cares about you, and I can't imagine any girl that could replace her. I've cried every night because of her. Whenever I try to focus at school or talk to someone, I think of her and I have to leave the room to cry.At this point, I know I'll never move on from her.

We tried to be friends, we managed to make it work for two months, but I never had time away from her after the break up due to our group of friends being very small and close knit.

So now things have changed, I couldnt take the pain so I decided that I wasnt going to complicate her life (her lifes pretty messed atm aswell) after making her cry at a halloween party (Im a dick for it I know but I really didnt mean to) and now I have lost the best friends I could ever ask for due to not being able to ask them to just hang out with me.

843,"This is maybe my third time posting, previously on throwaways. Fuck it, no more hiding.I feel so stupid writing this. Most other people in this subreddit have real problems - abusive childhoods, traumatic experiences with awful breakups/deaths/losing their kids/pets etc. By comparison I'm flawless. So why do I want to die? It's not even really that I want to die - I just don't want to be around anymore. I want everything to be gone - myself included. If I wasn't such a coward I would have already ended it all by now.I don't even know where to start with all this. I have no friends. The one relationship I managed to find where I truly could be myself broke up recently because my ex-fiancee didn't think we were compatible in the bedroom. We sold our house and now I am living in a hotel for a few months until my work visa expires and I have to return to my home country. I had to give up my pets.My body is hideous - scarred from cycles of rapid weight loss/gain over the years due to my binge eating to make myself feel better. The hobbies I once enjoyed no longer give me any pleasure. I have tried going to meetup groups and things to try and meet new people while doing the things I enjoy but these event always have cliques of people that already know each other and I can't seem to break into any of them - I just end up sitting there alone and miserable until I just leave. I can't even talk about my hobbies with regular people because I feel ashamed of them - they aren't ""normal"" things like watching sports and bullshit like that.I hate my job. The company I work for used to be small where everyone knew and talked to each other. Now we have gotten so big, I run into the clique problem at work too - I have no-one to talk to or have lunch with anymore because there is no-one at my work that shares my interests. I can't get in on any new projects at work because of changes in management - the new guy doesn't seem to like me and won't give me anything to do. All I do is fuck around on the internet all day and answer the odd question that people ask me. It's gotten so bad that I don't think I could actually do any real work now because I've been doing effectively nothing for years. It's a good thing I've been with the company for so long or I probably would have been fired long ago.Every time I see or hear other people together being happy I switch between either wanting to die because I know I will never have that, and wishing they were dead so I didn't have to see them and their happiness.Previously people on here have suggested stuff like adopting a kid or something. Yeah, great idea - I can't even take care of myself let alone another living creature.My parents try to be supportive. My dad is a completely different person to me (if you've seen Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, it's basically like Flint and his dad) and we don't really have anything in common. He doesn't know how to deal with any of this emotional stuff - he's an old-fashioned guy. My mum went through depression herself when I was younger (though she hid it well - I never even knew until she told me when I was diagnosed with it) and tries to offer support but it's like a broken record - the same unhelpful tips over and over again.The worst part is despite how bad I feel, I don't even want to change anymore. I think I am beyond help. I just want to be left alone. If I'm left alone I can scrape by being miserable, barely. But being surrounded by other people having a good time and having a great life makes me want to run away and hide. How can I get better if I don't even want to get better? Therapy has never helped because of this. I've been on meds but they always have bad side effects and are effectively a crutch - they mask the pain but don't fix anything.So, this is my wall of text. If you read it all, sorry for wasting your time. I'm going to send my will to the family lawyer then head up to the Golden Gate Bridge tomorrow night and maybe jump off if I can muster the courage._PERSON_, I'm sorry I could never be the man you believed I could be. _PERSON_, while we have almost nothing in common I still love you - I'm sorry I wasn't the son you wished you had.
