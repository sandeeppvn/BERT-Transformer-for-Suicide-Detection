10,2205,"Hello, I'm in my early 20's and just going through another self loathing period. I'm use to it, it's happened before, and I don't see it being out of my life any time soon. In my most recent period of being down, I had reoccurring thoughts of suicide. Now, when I say this, I mean it in a sense that I believe many of us actually think about it. What would it mean if I killed myself, would it be worth it, how would it affect my loved ones etc. Now, I've been having these thoughts, and I feel okay with them. I've come close to acting out on them before, but not recently. However, the problem I see is that I can't really think of talking to someone about my thoughts of suicide, just based on what people initially think. They will think that I need immediate help (which is thoughtful), but I feel as though just talking about it would be some sort of therapy in itself, something to help relieve myself. Yet, I really do think people commonly have thoughts of suicide. For me at least, it's a common thought process which so far has always lead to the same conclusion, it's not worth it. Also, I here people say that certain reasons are not ""good"" ones to commit suicide. Yet from what I understand, it's totally subjective. My upbringing/biology/current environmental factors together create a unique thought process and experiences, in which I feel that suicide would be the best option.Two questions than:1) Do you believe that general thoughts of suicide as I described are common amongst the general _PERSON_) Do you feel right judging the reasons for oneself to commit suicide? (Can you say with confidence that one's reasons may be ""nonsense""?""Not sure if this post is going to do much, but I just find getting my thoughts out to be relief enough.

11,2370,"This is going to be a long post, if you don't care to read it, then pass on by, that's understandable. I want you to know that, while at this very moment I am not sitting here with any immediate intention to kill myself, I must confess that the idea has been on my mind almost every moment of my life for the greater part of a decade, but has become worse in the last five or six. There are things about me that I have never shared with anyone, not my friends, family, therapist, clergyman or anyone, anywhere, for any reason. Lately, I have cared less and less about continuing a life of futility. I have a knee injury that has never healed properly and I am left in constant pain that feels like there is glass in my knee. At no moment of a day am I not in so much pain that it is on my mind. My prescription of _PERSON_ offers no relief at all, much to my dismay. I have lived with this pain now for over a year and have seen medical professionals who passed it off as me just trying to avoid work.In addition to that, I have COPD and have a hard time getting out and doing anything, so between the two, I have effectively become a shut in. My family believes I exaggerate the pain in my knee and the troubles that come with COPD to avoid work.Admittedly, I am a lazy person, but I actually enjoy work. I enjoy the feeling of completing something. So, when I am not longer able to do things as simple as walking my dog, depression starts to kick in...something no one has noticed after over a year. My family and friends don't recognize my depression because I always put a smile on because I don't want them to worry about me, because then I'd feel guilty.But all of that, I think I could live with and be okay. It's what has been with me for as long as I can remember (around 6 or so). In 28 years on this planet, I have never told anyone in detail about what goes on in my head every day, all day and has shaped almost every decision I have ever made in my adult life. For the record, I am a pacifist and do not condone violence for any reason, but that is where the problem lies. I act and believe in pacifism, but I am not at peace.Every moment, of every day for almost my entire life, I love the idea of rape, murder, torture and straight up just mutilating people. I spend all day thinking about it and how to do it the best way. There are no exceptions, children, elderly, women, men, transgender, anyone and everyone. I want everyone to suffer and feel pain, agony and fear. At the same time, I want people to be happy and safe. I do more for others than I do for myself. I buy other people things with my money and rarely spend on myself. I am always there to help anyone I see in need. However, while I do it, I think of the best way to kill them or whatever else.I am so, so tired of living with this in my head. It is exhausting and I am so ashamed of it that I am afraid to tell my family about it. Everyone thinks I make things up for whatever reason, so if they don't believe me over the physically evident things like my _PERSON_ or COPD, why would they ever believe me about this?  I had found ways to help calm the thoughts down, but they are either really bad outs or not sustainable. Marijuana, I have found, is a catch all remedy. It helps with the knee pain, it is used to help with COPD and also just mellows out the thoughts in my head, but it is quite expensive. Alcohol would lead to a dangerous addiction that has taken my father and both grandfathers, so I refuse to go that route. The only other thing that helped was Cigarettes...and well, COPD, so I had to quit. This made everything worse.So, here I am, sitting here again wondering why I should keep trying to deal with all of this. I no longer have insurance and when I tried to speak of my issues with a therapist before, she dropped me as a client before we could really get into any of it.I don't want to upset my family by killing myself, which I think is the only reason I haven't. I am truly afraid, I think, that there will be a trigger where I am no longer concerned with keeping my thoughts in and instead they become actions. I am afraid of the person I may become and for that reason I ask...Why should I bother sticking around, in pain, waiting for the day where I say fuck it and let loose on those around me and am remembered only as a headline?TL;DR: There isn't one.","I've argued with myself for years about killing myself, but only recently have I been unable to have a good reason not to.",long post care read pass understandable moment sitting intention kill confess idea mind moment life greater part decade worse things shared friends family therapist clergyman reason cared continuing life futility knee injury healed properly left constant pain feels glass knee moment day pain mind prescription person offers relief dismay lived pain year medical professionals passed avoid work addition copd hard time effectively shut family believes exaggerate pain knee troubles copd avoid work admittedly lazy person enjoy work enjoy feeling completing longer things simple walking dog depression starts kick noticed year family friends recognize depression put smile worry feel guilty live long remember years planet told detail head day day shaped decision made adult life record pacifist condone violence reason problem lies act pacifism peace moment day entire life love idea rape murder torture straight mutilating people spend day thinking exceptions children elderly women men transgender suffer feel pain agony fear time people happy safe buy people things money rarely spend kill tired living head exhausting ashamed afraid family thinks make things reason physically evident things person copd found ways calm thoughts bad outs sustainable marijuana found catch remedy helps knee pain copd mellows thoughts head expensive alcohol lead dangerous addiction father grandfathers refuse route thing helped cigarettes copd quit made worse sitting wondering deal longer insurance speak issues therapist dropped client upset family killing reason haven afraid trigger longer concerned keeping thoughts actions afraid person reason bother sticking pain waiting day fuck loose remembered headline tl dr,argued years killing recently unable good reason,23.0,855.0,0.3617412308338584,1.0,3.8501476017100575,1.1780144620706274,1.0,247

I am in a really delicate and uncomfortable situation and would love some advice from someone who's experienced or dealt with this before.First, a bit of background. I have an old friend that I was kind to in high-school, because he didn't really have anyone (there were some rumors...i didn't take them seriously, and didn't think it was fair. So I decided to try and reach out). Because of that, He kind of latched on to me and has always referred to me as his best friend. I haven't seen him in about 8 years.  About 2 years ago he had some legal troubles (drugs). Which were then exacerbated when he fell asleep with a girl at a party. I assume they were both on drugs, but I'm told they both awoke with all of their clothes on, and he wasn't aware of any impropriety. unfortunately, the young woman told the university that he had sexually assaulted her. Long story short, he didn't have the resources to fight it (his parents died a couple years ago), and he went to jail for about 9 months. While he was in jail, i'd get the occasional letter that I would respond to (not wanting to be a jerk...we have some things in common, so I would humor him and we'd exchange fiction  and poetry we'd been working on to help him pass the time.) Now he's out and trying to pull his life back together, with no money, no family, and a prized spot on a sex offender registry.Which brings me to today.....I pull into work and get  a text that he's thinking about suicide. I have to go to a meeting in a few, but  as a ""Friend"" and a human I need to try to talk him out of it. I told him I had to go to a meeting and I'd give him a call on my lunch-break, does anyone have any advice on what I should actually say?additional background if necessary: Friend is in Narcanon, is not religious at all, is highly intelligent, and really really hates what he refers to as ""touchy feely, 12 step bullshit"" at NA.",I hope you guys can help,time posting hope posting place delicate uncomfortable situation love advice experienced dealt bit background friend kind high school rumors fair decided reach kind latched referred friend years years ago legal troubles drugs exacerbated fell asleep girl party assume drugs told awoke clothes aware impropriety young woman told university sexually assaulted long story short resources fight parents died couple years ago jail months jail occasional letter respond wanting jerk things common humor exchange fiction poetry working pass time pull life back money family prized spot sex offender registry brings today pull work text thinking suicide meeting friend human talk told meeting give call lunch break advice additional background friend narcanon religious highly intelligent hates refers touchy feely step bullshit na,hope guys,6.0,381.0,0.088134765625,0.0,2.3978952727983707,1.3828488561620795,1.0,119

(you know more than people think i am?) so after a little less than a month of no suicidal thoughts and about 3 months of not cutting i just went and cut. i dont know why, i dont really need to. my life has been pretty good to me latley. i just kind of felt like i needed to cut. honestly. my 'friends' just laugh in my face they call my a slut and talk about me behind my back, they lie to me, they wouldnt care. my mom is constanly telling me to be like the other kids and that im not doing things the way she is expecting me to and why cant i just be normal? my dad would take forever to notice and when he finally would hed go out to the bar since he wouldnt have to deal with me anymore. my boyfriend wouldnt care he wants to break up with me and i know it but he 'doesnt want to hurt me' any of the people i honestly care(d) about dont even remember me or they hate me too much to even say my name. and any one who comments on here i doubt any of you really care im just some kid on the internet. i think ill just go now.... my brother was in intnse care because he slit his wrist. we just got a call that he passed on.**Kyle was adopted and when my mom and step-dad got a divorce he went back to roaming from place to place. When he was a kid he ran away from his moms house, then child services took him away becasue she beat him alot. When my mom adopted him he was doing drugs and some other stupid stuff. After the divorce the rest of the family stopped talking to him and I am the only one who kept in touch. He was in and out of jail alot again before one day he just kinda had enough I guess and broke down. ...but i came back.so last night I told my boyfriend everything. We got into this huge fight and I cried alot which I don't normally do. I posted a status on Facebook saying.....""People would be better off this way. I wouldn't be worrying everyone, I wouldn't have to keep up my act. I wouldn't have to lie, to keep secrets from the ones I really do love. I wouldn't have to deal with any one, I'd be problem free and so would you (for the most part.) It's easy. If you'd just lemme disappear. I wouldn't come back to bother you after saying I wouldn't. I'd be gone for good. And that's the way it should be. I'm too much of a problem and too much for anyone to deal with. I'm sorry. Sorry for wasting your time, sorry for taking up space, sorry for hurting you, sorry for not telling you. Sorry if you miss me.""I told myself before I texted my boyfriend that he was going to say mean things and not to let them get to me. I didn't listen to myself though.So anyways...I told him I was going to slit my wrist and he replied ""Remember down the river not across the street"" My friend cussed him out and talked me out of it. Then he texted people for me for the rest of the night because I was crying so much. Sorry if this was a little out of order or confusing to read. I went by what I remembered first.TL;DR: Posted a suicide note on Facebook. Dumped my boyfriend. Took it harder than him. Had a friend talk me out of slitting my wrist. My best friend is amazing and I pretty much owe my life to him right now. When I first moved here it was summertime and I didn't know anybody, until one day this guy showed up and started messing with me and my cousin. When I realized that it was someone messing with us I went along with it and acted scared. Later we hung out in the yard, we talked about random things. My mom met him and she actually let us hang out. I moved across town, but we still kept in touch. It has been 5 years since I met _PERSON_ and he has helped me through so much, he has listened to everything I have had to say, he has held me while I cried, he has talked me out of suicide multiple times, and most of all he has been there right by my side every step of the way. _PERSON_ is the best friend anyone could ask for and I think everyone should have someone like him around. *k so most of this is pretty pointless till you get to the end....it will prolly get deleted but oh well... no really thats it im done hello? my name is taylor, i was just wondering if anyone her has spoken to my remmy recently? she was supposed to come over today and she never showed, she also isnt answering my texts/ calls? anyone have any info that could help? please i am freaking out! no one is there for me...my best friend is going to jail in two weeksmy boyfriend is scared to talk to me bc i know hes cheating on meim blocked from suicide hotlinesim done for my best guy friend was supposed to be going to jail soon...but now its not gonna happen for like two more years and hes saying that we did all that work cleaning him up and it was for nothing. my boyfriend said he cared about me. and now when i want to talk to him hes no where to be foundmy bestfrinds dad is being crazy, this in cludes riding around on an orange lawn moweri am still getting urges to cut and always feel the need to hide my wristand im wanting to just fight someone. i want to hit someone not a punching bag or a wall, i want to hit a living breathing person. but im also beginning to be less and less sure what i really want",i cant help it sometimes i think im just another problem horse shoes and hand grenades really myspace got rid of the ropes Should I Still Be Like This?

I've never had anything to fear when I overdose on heroin, in the blink of an eye, I had gone from conscious of an eternal bliss to a state of absolute disappointment for surviving the OD. You might as well say I'm lucky I shot up around friends,  lucky enough for them to have called 911 on me. I faced my mother's despair and sadness in the hospital that day, and I could just feel her pain and I couldn't imagine how much worse it would've been if I had died that night. The thought of my own mother having to bury the tomb of her son who was barely a man makes me cry my eyes out and hate what I had done. My sense of compassion only goes to others, I feel nothing but pity towards myself. I hate myself for absolutely no reason. I have everything a child could wish for, a caring mother,  loving family, close friends, and a great body image. However, I can't escape my sense of despair and life and absolute nihilism. Killing myself is the same as going to school, the feelings towards each is the same as in the way I approach both in terms or value, with purely rational thought. My own irrationality, the instinct for survival leads me to continue on living performing acts which only grant me even greater despair.  I have no choice for I am a selfless coward, I fear hurting my family and causing them pain, even post mortem. I wish I died that day I overdosed. It would've been a perfect time to die. If my mother and family were gone, I would immediately kill myself through overdose, who wouldn't?  Yet I'm still suicidal in my daily life. I hate myself. I hate living. I hate crying. I hate happiness. They are no more greater than the other.

I rarely see family. She did attempt suicide once; I had left to be with my brother and father, I had only been gone one hour. All that saved her was her inexperience at tying knots. She was our primary bread winner until she could no longer work, now i work 3 jobs, including the National Guard. I can't leave, and yet i have to.I love her very much, and happily work myself to death if it would help us. But it doesn't. We're financially circling the drain, which is endlessly frustrating considering my own lack of of sleep, and meals we've both missed just to keep the basics.Every solitary moment i spend, driving from one job to the next or trying to sleep, i fantasize and killing myself now,which seems do strange. Im healthy and strong. I'm young and ambitious. Yet these days just getting sleep is the closest i get to relief.  I wish things like i hope we go to the range this month so they will give me ammo, or may some box will fall off the shelf at work and just end it.I find that I can't live this way. But she will never change, we've tried a lot and are continuing treatment, but nothing seems to help very much. I still can't leave her alone.I can't do the things I enjoy, because I need to keep her as happy as possible at all times. no one else is willing to deal with her, mostly because her family is not a very good family, and she can be very stressful to be around sometimes. Her moods are erratic. But she means well all of the time, that's why I love her. She cares very much about other people.I don't know if I'm making sense, or if this is even the appropriate forum.

So I looked at the major things I wanted to achieve and worked my ass off to get them. I now have a 3.9 GPA in an engineering degree, a high paying internship at a fortune 500 company, gained 30 lbs lifting weights and through heavy doses of Accutane last year, got rid of my acne. I tried very hard to become more social, gained some friends and have had a couple girlfriends in the last 2.5 years. Yet, all of these great things have piled up so high and now consume such a huge amount of time that I just feel completely buried under it all. I never have a moment to sit down and take a breath. I've worked so hard to get to where I am, but I'm just miserable. From the outside looking in I'm doing fantastic, but from the inside looking out, I've never felt worse.

Still no progress on my college project, I'm in a dysfunctional group. I'm depressed, some are stoners, other hope someone else will do it and get credit for the project. Christmas is here, I don't want christmas. It lost all it's meaning. When I was a child christmas brought warm fuzzy feelings and deep emotional connection. Now it's an ordeal of mental and physical strength. And because I'm the ""most"" responsible in the college group I have to explain everything. I want to answer with suicide. So after a very dark 2014 I wanted to do something about my suicidal tendencies and depression. Various self-help guides advised me to find a 'passion'. Asking for 'what do  you want in life'. I then realized that I didn't really want anything except *to die*. So what exactly makes death more appealing than the vast riches this world can offer to me? I got suggestions like start a family, get a car, become millionaire,... but I don't care about them. It's like my suicide attempts completely changed my value system.

Everything bad is back. Its destroying me. I dont know who to talk to, my parents just left to the other side of the world. Dont know whether I should go back on antidepressants. Dont know if I can talk to friends about this.I'm at that point again where I can't make decisions anymore. help? Thinking about suicide again. Can't keep doing this. Even made my plan, although I don't know how effective it will be.Wrote down the steps, but I can't post them here. For the better I suppose.It's looping in my mind. I'm scared that it will be painful, and am sure it will be. I feel so normal about it and it scares me.I have a lot of friends, and can imagine them and my family being very upset. Only a very few and my parents know of my struggle. I don't feel keeping myself alive is worth the pain that I will have to keep facing and the pain it saves them.It feels like I am going through with it. I just need an opportunity.

I have a depressive episode every 2 weeks which lasts on average 1-3 days or sometimes longer depending on extrinsic factors. Been on anti-depressants before, and my parents are aware of my situation, although they still don't really understand that it's not a choice.I'm still in my latest episode after 1 week, which consists mostly of me thinking of suicide with minor influence of other symptoms. I have changed much of my lifestyle to minimise the influence of depression, but I'm failing after holding strong for 1 year and the suicidal thoughts are becoming visualisations again, and I'm starting to get suicidal tendencies.Failing mostly due to a lot of stress of fixing what my severe depression of a year ago ruined, and I didn't have to face it till now. This stress period will last 2.5 months and I'm already feeling the lowest I have been in a year, creeping to severe depression levels.I don't know if I can make it through :( I have changed my suicide plan already, one that guarantees success having learned from my past mistakes.I feel destroyed atm, and I don't feel like I can tell my parents or anyone. I don't want this to continue for the rest of my life. I would like someone to check in with me for a week. Just send me a message saying ""check"" and I'll reply the same back. :( just for a week, so that I can get myself back together, because I'm afraid that if I don't it will get worse, and I can't do worse again :(Please :(",Need help with a decision.

34,6375,"Every day, since the second day of school this year, I've sat next to a particular friend at lunch. We've known each other for over two years, but lately he's been abnormally sad some days, and normal others. Today he asked me why I sit with him, and I told him that he is my friend. He said I was his last friend. After a bit more discussion, he said that I kind of annoyed him, and he wanted me to sit inside. A friend of mine told me to show him that I would care if he died, but I am not entirely sure how, especially since he doesn't seem to want to be my friend anymore (he unfriended me on Facebook, too, as frivolous as that may sound). I'm not sure what to do, and I'm afraid of telling someone, because everything might end up being fine, but I'm terrified that I'll end up not saying anything, and he'll kill himself. EDIT: He's been isolating himself from everyone, too. This year, he's been really, really antisocial in general. EDIT 2: Earlier this year, he mentioned wanting to actually do stuff with other people (as in, hang out and other social activities). But he said he was too socially awkward, and didn't have enough friends. Today I asked him if he would still attend Doctor _PERSON_ (an after school club, which another friend and I are trying to restart), and he said no. He's changed his mind about wanting to do stuff with other people, apparently, and just sits around watching anime all the time. I first made a Reddit account to post [this.](_URL_ the elapsed time, my friend has moved across the country. We now communicate purely through text. He isn't the most social person, despite wanting to be, and hasn't made any friends. Now he feels like there's no point to anything, and doesn't have the motivation to do homework. He has a pocketknife and a sword in his room. I don't know what to say when he talks about how he can't take this any more. He doesn't have any hopes or dreams for the future that he's said or even hinted at, or even a favourite subject at school. What can I say?

35,6537,"I wanted to have one friend. Just one. But im not worth it. I'm not worth anything. I said something that I shouldn't have said and it was taken wrong. I can't do this. I hurt a friendship between other people then had an anxiety attack while talking to someone I thought was my friend but I mess everything up. I'm too scared to ever talk to him again. I cause problems for the other which is my boyfriend. I'm so messed up and I out him through so much that I don't mean to. I can't do this. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I don't wanna talk to my boyfriend anymore because I only cause problems and I know it. I can't kill myself apparently it's not working again. I wish it would finally work. I guess I just can't do this. I think I should honestly just get over myself and finally make the choice to end it. I just keep stalling. I've tried before, but I haven't succeeded. I don't think there's a point being here anymore. It's just one bad thing after another. I can't do anything right. I guess I just want to vent. Any people I care about all have these bases of close friends that will try and help them or intervene when things get bad. I've been one of the people helping all of them. But no one cares to do that for me. I pass out really easily, my parents don't like me, my family is just messed up, I have too many health problems, I can't succeed in killing myself, and so many other things. I don't mean to be selfish when I say I wish I had that group of people. I just mean. Here's an example: I have had issues with hydration for years and heat problems. I pass out or get close to it really often. Recently another girl at school in similar classes has developed a similar thing. Everyone cares about her. Everyone. She's an awesome girl. I'm not saying anything bad about her. But no one notices mine or cares. The few people that notice that I care for and help them when tHings get bad, theyve never done that for me. I wish I was worth that much to someone. My family just loves telling me I'm shit then half heartedly pretending to be supportive.  Or whenever I work, every costumer in the room acknowledges any other employee but me. If I've been cleaning for an hour, barely able to stand up (I have minor scoliosis. Not complaining but it makes things where you bend over harder. ) and another employee comes out, they'll compliment how great they're doing and ignore me. Last summer I would try to talk to people I know online. They'd ignore me. Some would say hi first then after like two messages decide I'm not worth talking to. Why doesn't anyone care about me? I feel selfish wanting that but everyone seems to have it but me. I guess in reality if I had close friends that cared and they tried to intervene and talk to me about what's going on I'd just start hyperventilating and freaking out. I'm not worth it anyways I guess. Haven't been since I was born. No wonder no one wants to be friends with me. I can't even succeed at getting rid of myself. I'm useless and stupid. I just got home from prom. Should be great. But. Plans took forever to make and were ruined multiple times.  One in my friend group kept slyly insulting me because I asked them if they were okay months ago because it seemed like something was wrong (they were being really mean then) so they kept insulting me. Then acting friendly. My plans for after got ruined and the plans for the day after. Everything a normal teenager can do did special days always gets fucked up. My parents hate me. I hate it here. I just wanna kill myself already. I try to kill myself constantly it never works I can't do this I hate this i hate everything im so tired I just wanna leave I can't exist I'm useless and fat and ugly and no one cares I wanna suffocate I hate breathing I'll never be worth anything I wanna fucking die why can't I fucking leave that's all I want I don't wanna be here I didn't ask to be born no one wanted me to be born anyways I'm tired of everything please I can't ever do what I like. I know that I guess. I'll never get any opportunities in theatre anymore because of my bull shit asshole filled highschool theatre program. I don't think I'm great alright? But I used to know I was good. I'm trained in dance, vocal, acting, and I came from an arts school. But they all treat me like shit. I fucking hate them. I never tell them that of course though. I just have dreams all the time about finally being in a production again, then I wake up and it's all gone. Everything is gone. I'll never have it again. I'll never get to work with people and entertain the audience. I'm apparently good enough to be exploited for solos but I can't have even an ensemble part in a fucking show. I have tons of experience. I'm suicidal. I'm depressed. I'm anxious. I go for weeks without sleep on end. The only thing I still like, out of music, guitar, violin, piano, singing, etc is theatre. That's all I want. Musical theatre. That's why I moved here. I've been nice to all of those shit heads. They're all mean to me. They always have been. It's been years. No one understands how much I miss entertaining everyone on stage. But I can never have it again. Every community theatre is some how fucking attached to people at that damn school. I've auditioned a million times for everything. The theatre class at school was terrible to me. I'm fine with critiques y'know, or I wouldn't enjoy theatre. But the top kids in the class ridiculed me daily and the teacher supported it. This is my LIFE. This is everything to me.  My parents are emotionally abusive and treat me terribly all the time. I can't get a job because I have scoliosis and most minimum wage jobs require bending. I can barely drive because of my back. My parents took away my lessons with my favorite teacher, whose like a father to me, and keep refusing to give them back. I feel like I make my boyfriend buy things constantly like food. I hate it when people spend money on me.  Everyday gets worse and worse. It hurts so badly that I am honestly suprised I haven't just stopped existing. My biological mom (who did drugs, is a pathological liar, used to be alcoholic, lied to government) won't leave me alone online. I can't see my little sister because she lives with her and my biological mom is crazy and just tells me off for ridiculous things.

37,7241,"It just seems like the best option. I don't even know why. But, today I learned that the only reason my mom hasn't yelled at me for being an attention-seeking bitch, is because my stoic dad (who is in UAE right now, with another 8 months before he comes home) told her not to. Because he's worried about me. And you know it's bad when my dad starts to worry. But I have a few great friends who care, and a great life, and ambitions and dreams, but I just want all of this yelling and screaming and hating myself to end. Permanently. And it's not easy. I tried to commit suicide three years ago, and again two weeks ago. I was supposed to have an appointment with a doctor this week. My counselors told my mom that she had to schedule an appointment, and yet, she's said nothing. She hasnt even brought it up. Its like she doesnt see how serious this is.~~Its like she doesnt even care~~  This post seems kind of all over the place, but I just wanted to let it out... I feel a bit selfish posting here, when there are others that are closer to death than I am. I just... I don't have a plan yet, and I'm scared that I'll come up wih one soon. I don't want that to happen. I don't want to die. But everywhere I turn, it seems like all I do is fuck up everything. My own mother tells me I'm useless. Almost daily. And she knows I'm suicidle. Which leads me to wonder, maybe she doesn't want me alive? It sounds so selfish, I have younger siblings that would miss me. Or at least, I hope they would. But I'm 15 and turning to alcohol for an escape. I'm trying to stop, for my boyfriend and for my best friends, but I dont want to live like this any longer; on so many slopes that one day I'll trip and everything will snowball and I'll be alive to watch everything I have, and everything I am, burn to the ground and I'll just be left to pick at the ashes.~~I want to be dead before that happens~~ I don't want this life, where my own mother knows I'm walking towards the edge and won't help me, but encourages by her hateful words. Where my best friend's overprotective boyfriend tells me I'm just like the rest of the generation of stupid girls who give up everything for nothing. Where the only place I know that is safe is my boyfriends arms, and that this paradise is so rarely visited. Where I don't want to jump, but the unknown at the edge of the cliff is so much more inviting, and ~~maybe the angels with soft down wings will stroke my hair while I sleep~~ forever~~ I just don't know what to do. Or where to go from here. I've made too many mistakes to count, too many mistakes that I can't deal with. Everyone around me tells me that it's the selfish thing to do, that I'd make an impact on them if I died. But they would all move on at some point anyway, right?I've tried so hard to be perfect, like them, despite the hand I was dealt at birth. So can't I have this, for me? I'll give it all back, I'll give everything away, just to let everything go, to sleep for eternity and not worry about getting in anyone's way, ever again. I want to remove the problem from everyone's life, and that problem is me. I'm easily replaced in every aspect, except my family. And they're the ones that will hurt the most, but one day, they'll move on, and be okay. Everything will return to normal. I'm not important, I'm not outstanding, I'm not beautiful or perfect. Hell, I'm not even close to acceptable. I've made terrible mistakes. And I can't make any more. I don't want the rest of my life, and I'd give the extra years away, if I could. I just can't deal with anything anymore. I am too weak and too fragile for this world. I wish it didn't have to be this way, ever, but I'm not good enough. I never was. And I see that, now. So I'm sorry, _PERSON_, I'm sorry, Kayla, I'm sorry to the love of my life, _PERSON_, I'm sorry for all of my family and anyone who knows me, but I can't keep going. I wasn't born with the strength you were. I'm broken, shattered. I hope you tell _PERSON_ that it is the weak thing to do. And that I am a perfect example of weakness. I don't know what to do. It seems that suicide would be the only way out. And that's what I do; run at the first sign of danger...I don't know what else to say. But if you see this, thanks for reading through. I appreciate it, stranger. I'm sorry I'm not the responsible woman you want me to be. I'm sorry for being such a pain in your ass. Most of all, I think I'm sorry for not screaming at you that it wasn't my fault, that you can't see that I'm dying right in front of you. I'm not the self-centered girl you think I am. I spend every waking moment thinking of how my death could benefit everyone around me. I guess not acting on it is kind of selfish, in a way.When I die, you could sell all my stuff (except Mr. Behr- I want him to be buried with me) and with the money you get from my beloved paints, and paintbrushes, you could hire a babysitter who's responsible and not a drunk, so you can go to your sister's wedding and be the maid of honor. You won't have to worry about it anymore. Dad will be home soon, and he'll be able to help you with the babies. You won't have to worry about me or yell at me for staying in bed all day because I am so, so very tired. I'll be asleep for a very long time.You won't have to worry about me being a lazy fatass anymore. You won't have to worry about my grades slipping or how I've got 87 scars on my thighs, or how I've been drinking all your liqueur, and can't stop. You won't have to worry about me failing as a person, or getting pregnant, or being homeless, because I will never get that far in life. I'll be asleep in my grave, with my teddy bear, safe and sound and happy.You won't have to worry anymore. I'm sorry I wasted 15 years of your life. but I'm doing one selfless thing to make up for it.Sincerely, Arielle. I am so useless. My dad has been deployed for a few months now and I should be helping, I should be being useful but instead I'm slicing up my thighs like theyre deli meats. I can't even eat like a human-fucking-being. I just have to shove it all in *because I'm just* *that much* *of a pig* and fall on the floor weeping about how I'll never be pretty, or useful, or even remotely appreciated because with everyone I know, I need them more than they need me. Just a fat little piggy. This piggy should be sliced up nice and thick and served on silver plates to everyone shes met, as an apology. That would be a start. I can't sleep. I stay up so late and crash as soon as I get home from school. But I can't sleep then, because motherbeast is screaming and wailing and it hurts my heart. I wish I had never been born, I really do.

41,8588,"I am feeling quite depressed and suicidal, despite the fact that I never usually feel like this. I had a breakdown earlier this week, bursting into tears because my friend has been taken away from me and I can't talk to him in public. All my school work in getting on top of me and stressing me out. To make things worse, someone who was bullying me got stabbed after I stood up for him, now I feel guilty. I also have to report one of my friend's for child pornography. With all this going on, I'm just becoming so stressed and upset and thinking that life is actually pointless. What am I to do? I've never been a big lover of life, I think too much to enjoy the little things. However, I've always trudged through life with the hope of being successful and having enough material things to make up for happiness. Suddenly, life hit me and I gained friends who I cared about and I started to feel a little better about myself and my Autism.Now, I just feel empty again. Most of my friends are leaving me or they've fallen out with me. My family's financial situation is horrible, I'm being kicked out of my home by my own grandmother and we are in debt. My mother is depressed and we don't get on. Everyone is arguing, I hate how life is for us. My father pays no attention to me, he's off having an affair on his current wife who is horrible to me.I get bullied and I only trust two people, I fucked it up pretty bad with one of them by confessing my feelings for him. I've made his life pretty shit over the past few years, he would have a much better life without me here. Everyone would. I make everyone's life worse, I'm a huge burden.I wish life was simple again, where I only cared about myself and my possessions. Why did I have to love? I just want to sink into the floor. I don't know what is real anymore and it's hard. I'm really not coping well, being so socially troubled and autistic. I can't deal with extreme emotion. This love, this pain, it's killing me. He knows of my feelings and my fear of rejection, yet he tells me he hates me, I'm too clingy and that he only became friends with me because he pitied me.He is avoiding me and saying hurtful things to me. It's probably my fault, I deserve it. I am too possessive.He sits and laughs with his friends about the situation, but says he's depressed and that he's sick of feeling guilty. A year ago, I hit his friends, I had anger issues. Now, I'm coping with it and I haven't been violent for ages.I feel tired and sick all the time, even when I do sleep. I can't concentrate on my studies and I'm regressing. He said that I'll end up hurting myself and today, I did. I smacked my head against a table. It made my headache worse.

I've collected my senses a little bit since then. I didn't mean to waste your time. I don't think I can take it anymore. I absolutely hate living. I want to just end it all. Every day, I keep thinking more and more about why I'm still alive, and I'm running out of reasons to stay this way. People always say that it's a selfish thing to do, but after all of this, don't I deserve one thing to myself? I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to suffer anymore. I'm tired of pretending that life is actually worth it. I'm only 20, and I've already seen enough of this world to know I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I want to be gone, and I want to be forgotten. Is that too much to ask?",I just want to quietly die in my sleep.

63,12900,"I'm so done with everyone, everything. All I've ever done, been, my whole life was the replacement. The punching bag. The diary. Journal. The expendable one no one thought had anything wrong. All my life I've sat back and watched everyone be happy, find a purpose, if someone was down, they came to me. That was enough to keep me going. Recently its been harder and harder to breathe, think, function. I can't even fake a smile anymore without it hurting. All anyone ever says is ""she'll get over it."" I'm fed up and done with everything, I just want to end it.EDIT 1: thank everyone who replied, it honestly made me smile. I remembered who I was and the purpose I had, why I smiled before. All of you are wonderful people and I cannot thank you enough for helping me. I don't care if it looks like I'm attention whoring, I need to cry but I can't anymore. It hurts to smile. I'm tired of everyone dumping their burdens on me and then just leaving expecting me to be okay. I'm not a pack-mule. I can't carry endless burdens without collapsing sooner or later. I feel like I'm falling endlessly into an abyss with nothing but hell above or below. It's cold, I'm numb, its dark blew out my light, sucking me farther down into its depths. An endless pit or my own sorrow, only ending when I hit a rock along the way. Around memorial day I found a deformity on my ribs, I pass out frequently, I'm dizzy, it's easy to get overworked and overheated. I fucked up and lost the only person that understood me, and when I started letting someone inside my walls again all they did was tear me down from the inside out and left a flame in their place. This is my 5th post to here I believe? I've lost track of the times I've needed to post here. Everytime I try to kill myself it fails. Its never worked or I've been to cowardly to do it. My life is falling apart at the seams, everyone is leaving me. There is nothing more I would like than closing my eyes and sleeping forever. On November 2 I will kill myself, there is no if ands or butts about it. I'm needed now, if I weren't I would do it today. My heart was shattered and the one that could fix it no longer wants me in his life. I don't know what I do for people to leave me but they always do. I'll help them out of tough times only for them to leave my life. So now I'm leaving it too. I'll make this quick, 2 weeks ago I posted that after November 2nd I wouldn't be needed anymore but I figured why wait. I'm a people pleaser, I'd rather see everyone happy and me on the brink of bursting out crying than worrying for myself. I just permanently lost the one person I would give anything for, and I lost him willingly. I want for him to be happy and move on but where does that leave me? I make all my friends so happy they all have needed me at some point but now..they all are moving on too. I honestly have no point to life right now, everything is fading away.

64,13018,"I don't really know where to start. I feel absolutely hopeless. Worthless. I enjoy next to nothing anymore. I've been clinically depressed for over a year now, and recently it's only gotten worse. I am filled with guilt and dread over the things that I've done or said. Suicide is the answer for me. My boyfriend left because of my shitty actions. My parents hate me; my mother is in love with only herself and claims zero fault. Every time we argue she never fails to let me know that I'm spoiled and manipulative and a bitch. Recently she screamed at me telling me I'm 'ruining everything' as she has just moved back in with my father and I. My dad physically attacked me when I called her stupid (because he's never heard the verbal abuse she's pulled on me, so I was in the wrong. Obviously) and I now have a huge problem looking directly at him. I am 18 so I'm aware I can move out, yet as the only child, they have guilted me into staying at home, blaming the fact that we dont have enough money for me to live with my friends (though I've stated that by summer I'll have saved enough from my job that I could leave if I wanted to. They only make other excuses.) They use the fact that we moved states 'for me', only furthering the guilt and making me feel as though I owe them.The comunity college here is shitty; I refuse to feel any more of a burden by asking my parents to pay for my out-of-state tuition.I was refused by a great daycare place because of my past suicide attempts. They deemed me too unstable to work with children which absolutely destroyed me, as I looked forward to meeting coworkers my age and making kids days better. I've applied to five other places, and it makes me sad that no one has called me back yet. My mother tells me I'm supposed to help the family, and I have be applying for five jobs in a two week period, yet she sits on her ass all day relying on her retirement check and my father to support her.My ex can never decide if he wants to be with me or not, which is mentally and emotionally draining. He's truly a great guy but younger than me, so he's very confused on everything. He saved me from an abusive ex and we get along together so fantastically, yet he left because I can be a real bitch sometimes-my words, not his- and I have a problem with lashing out when I'm angry or sad.Every part of my body is literally weighed down by this depression. My head constantly hurts. I'm too guilty and tired to eat. I'm too depressed to work out like I normally do. The medicine they have me on only helps slightly. I feel that for me to be important other people have to want me, and it feels like nobody wants me so my self talk is complete shit. I literally see no point for me to be alive. I believe everybody has potential and a story. Maybe _PERSON_ intended my story to end in suicide. I'd love to be a clinical psych and help other children and adults like myself but I just cannot find the strength to push forward anymore. I'm drained. I'm so tired. I wake up to the thought of suicide. I go to bed with the thought of suicide. I found a site that said short suspension hanging is less painful than any other method of suicide. I don't know what to do. I see little reason for me to be alive at this point in time. I'm tired of the ""it gets better bullshit"". How can I force myself to not be depressed when every fiber of my being is fucking tired of being alive. I posted here a few weeks ago. The people who commented were helpful. I've decided to take my own life today. I feel very sad but I haven't felt so happy in a long time. I hope God can forgive me for this. I hope all of you know how important and wonderful you are. Please know that you are so powerful and you can do whatever you put your mind to. I hope you never feel like suicide is the answer, though that's really hypocritical of me to say.

66,13197,"I have quit school, it was horrible going there everyday while being depressed and all. My parents don't seem to understand me and I am at the point where I feel suicidal and what's holding me back is my boyfriend who lives very very far away. So I'd say I am not directly suicidal, I just think a lot about it even tho I wouldn't be able to do it. All I'd want to ask for here is some good words... I have been in meetings for 5 hours today so I really don't feel like talking about my situation more... I just need some good words to make me feel less like a fail person and maybe a bit more cheerful... I am always so negative, I told my mom that jumping from a bridge sounds more appealing than continuing life, why am I this negative.. I have people who love me, and people who I love. I have a long distance boyfriend who I look very much forward to meeting in probably two years. It's quite a while, but for a suicidal person, having something to look forward to is good, isn't it? There's also an event in May I look very much forward too as well. Also, next month, new season of a tv show I like a lot. See, I have things to look forward to, I have things that makes me happy. Like my cats, gaming, music. Still I keep thinking about wanting to die. I don't want to leave my boyfriend or my family behind, so deep inside me I don't want to die at all. It's especially when people ask me what I want to do with life, when am I gonna stop gaming all night, what will you work with, why did you drop out of school and what will you do now. All kinds of questions. I dropped out of school recently because it was difficult as hell to go there and I gave up. It's my second time dropping out, now I have given up. At least here in Norway I know I won't end up on the street, we always get money to survive and a place to stay even if we're unable to afford it ourselves. That's what I've learnt at least. I have no idea what to work with, I can't handle anything. I hate humans and I hate most things, and then I hate myself for hating all of it and I can't stop myself from it either. I enjoy sitting up all night and gaming while I talk to my teammates on skype. I enjoy being at home and just chilling with my computer and my cats. I know very well I can't just do this my whole life, no need to tell me what I already know. But whenever I get asked those questions I mentioned over, or I just end up thinking about them, all these suicidal thoughts come. I know that I won't live until I get old unless I get help for this, lots of help. I went to therapy once before, lived in a clinic for depressed/anxious/self harming/suicidal etc people. I applied to move into one again to get help, I went to get help by my own will, because I am afraid that I might end up killing myself when I'm at my worst, because I tend to forget everything positive and it might go wrong.Am I really stupid for this? Do I deserve to die? I feel like I do because I am so filled with negativity. Is there any self-help methods I can do at least until I get to hear from the clinic I applied to? What if I don't get to move into there? I am very bad at telling people exactly how I feel and I make it sound like it's not as bad as I feel inside me, and the doctor who wrote the application for me was Danish so it was a bit difficult to communicate too. If I don't get in, I don't even know what to do. I am just afraid to kill myself, because I don't want to leave people behind me, hurt because of their loss. That's my main reason to stay alive. Even tho I know I'm loved by some, I still have so bad self confidence... I can't do this life anymore, help me..","i have given up on almost everything, at least that's how I feel right now.

69,13317,"How can the right road always be the saddest one? Will that ever stop? I think have emotions on a scale 10x what most people do. its also impossible to make anyone understand what experiencing that on a daily basis is like. What a sad thought, sharing your mind with your own worst enemy.I was born with so much joy and awe in me. I was molested by my older brother as a little girl. I don't know exactly how old, 8, 9? I never understood. When I did, I could not tell anyone. I couldn't hurt my family that way. After, I became convinced something was wrong with my body from it. I was too young to understand. I thought no one would ever love me. I planned to kill myself before I got old enough for people to find out. I cried every night12 &amp; 13 I watched my older sister suffer under anorexia. We shared a room together and I would hear her weep when she thought I was asleep. She would get up in the dark and exercise. My parents were overwhelmed and I was understandably unimportant in those circumstances. Looking back now I see how much help I needed, going into adolescence very lonely and sad. At 15 I met a boy who had just turned 17. Over the next 3 years, he became my best friend and I loved him, so much. He had difficult problems with mental illness (severe depression, maybe schizophrenia). By the time I was 17 (2010), he had tried to kill himself many times and I was at the end of my rope in distress. I didn't know how to help anymore. May 2010 he found his mother dead, suddenly. He started having horrible nightmares and fear and things got worse. After a serious attempt, I finally asked him to at least tell me next time so that I could say goodbye. He did. On Oct. 2nd he instant messaged me... it is hard to describe this conversation. He had taken 208 pills (I can never forget these things). I talked to him as he died. as he told me about his arms going numb. I wept and wept and asked him how was I supposed to go on? how could I ever laugh again? I knew I could intervene but I didn't. I had watched him suffer so long. I let him die. There is a father out there who lost his wife and his son in the same year. That will always be my burden. it will always be what I did.I almost cannot remember the darkness of the following winter. I was so ashamed and kept so much secret. few people knew what I was dealing with. 21 now, but the pain from this has barely faded, and the damage is permanent. I search desperately for a sense of security in my relationships. i am in terror of being abandoned, and yet I find myself so often crushingly alone.A two and a half year relationship that I would do anything, anything I could to fix has just fallen apart because of struggles with mental illness. He told me over and over that he did not have the ability to be with anyone in his life right now, and could not give me time or affection. I've spent the last few months in silence without him, struggling to stay above my demons. This week he messaged me with only painful things to say. He fucked someone new. im crushed and I can't understand. He's left me in silence againnow I can't cause myself enough physical pain to feel calm. i'm beating myself to nothing, my legs are covered in dark bruises. all my joy is gone and I try to keep going through every day with wave after wave of black pain. I have wanted so so badly to die for years. The people I love have no idea how much love it takes to keep going every day. I did not want to do to them what I have experienced.

71,13750,"Hi reddit.  Some background:  I'm 16 and a junior in high school.  For the first two years, I kept very good grades.  But this year, through a combination of stress, severe ADD, and inability I've more or less annihilated any chance of scholarships or getting into a good college.  I have no desire to waste the college money my parents have put forth.My parents are married, but my father has never really been in my life.  Just today I was in a concert that we've practiced months for, but my dad decided not to come and he didn't ask me about it when I got back. This kind of detachment has been present with him my whole life. My mother might have loved me, but my recent (in)action to fix my life have only driven her further away, and she is even more wrathful and depressed because of me.Additionaly, I have no close friends as I am very awkward and withdrawn, and I can't recall even being invited to ""hang out"" with anyone since middle school.I had about a year long relationship with my girlfriend, who I still love dearly, but I kept this secret from most everyone as she and her parents are atheists, and I feared my parents reaction.  Last weekend I broke things off, though, because I've been under so much stress that it overtakes her whenever we're together, which is profoundly unfair to her.I've witnessed my parents marriage go from stagnant to deteriorating over the last few months, and almost guarantee it is a product of the stress I have brought them.  So my question is this: Should I commit suicide to avoid hurting my family further, or if not, what other alternative is there?  Regardless of the answer, if you could be somewhat detailed so I can minimize the impact of my decision on others, I would be very grateful. I want to die.  I've deluded myself into thinking I am a victim of circumstance, and now that I realize I'm not, I can see I've ruined any hope I had at a good life.

78,15127,"Everything I read makes me convinced that we are headed towards a hellish existence: increased surveillance, resource depletion, climate change, economic instability, all subjects that are scientifically documented and with no practical solutions available to them. We will probably all live in a 1984-esque nightmare or end up farming for 12 hours a day and spending the rest of the time fighting for our survival.Dealing with this knowledge is more than I can bare. Just mentioning any sort of negative thing to my parents (and I hold back a LOT) has them immediately go into ""stop being so negative"" mode. I wonder if they are simply ignorant or aware of all this and just want to pretend it's not happening.I wonder if I subconsciously want them to stop hoping. My greatest dream is that all my loved ones would come to me and say ""We have decided to give you a present: This pill will give you a painless death. Don't worry about us, we know this is what you want. We will not mourn because we know that your suffering will end. Farewell and good luck"". Instead I keep at this because I don't want to cause them pain. so I take it in return. I don't want to live in hell. I spend at least 4 hours a day on the Internet. The presence of other people for long periods of time bores me. I don't want to learn how to defend myself. I don't want to lose all of this. I know I am a terrible person for it. I just wish that we as people weren't forced to keep playing the game of life after we already lost. I never asked for this life. I never asked to feel disconnected from people. I never asked to be forced to get a job in a country where I don't speak the language, have no time to learn it and is constantly on the brink of disappearing. Never asked to be in a world on the brink of collapse. Never asked to be raised my entire life to shun physical activity and be faced with a world in which we all have to toil in the dirt.I have lost the game of life. And yet I am forced to keep playing it. Only my family keeps me here. Even though I can't relate to them either and they drive me crazy with their insensitivity to my pain. The only thing keeping me alive is my unwillingness to cause so much pain to those around me. I don't want to leave the world a worse place than it is.Yet I keep dreaming about it. I drea that one day all those who care about me would give me a gun with a single bullet and say ""We understand that this is what's best for you.

I just skimmed over some other topics on here and the rules for a few seconds before jumping into this because i Really feel like I'm in full panic mode and my ""OCD"" is going off, so really twitchy and all that. So what set me off is that I'm transgender, and occasionally get episodes of dysphoria. What that means exactly is every so often there are moments of extreme emotional pain and its awful.I've been transitioning for about 3 and a half years and I hear stuff from people that have been transitioning for this long and that they feel much better and rarely feel awful and their lives did a 360 and its going smooth, whatever. And after 3 and a half years of this, there has been some improvement but for this to still be happening is fucking insane. This shouldn't be happening anymore.So apart from that, its also around May, June which is graduation time and occaisonally you go on facebook and it is swamped with ""friends"" posting graduation pictures and all this stuff and after going to community college for I think 5 years, I'm 23, and seeing people doing that and getting on with their lives it is really toxic to see all that, also never been the most social person, basically a loner so seeing things from old friends who aren't friends anymore and people being social and groups of friends and all that stuff it really fucking hurts, like a lot.Also been looking over other peoples transitions for the past hour and I've been making myself feel worse in an attempt to get myself to feel bad enough to kill myself, and I'm still doing it because like I said, I just want it to stop.

83,15769,"*For the record, I am not suicidal or depressed whatsoever, just wanted to ask a question.*Bascially, my father was a royally fucked-up person. He was often in-and-out of jail, completely poor, homeless, likely a pedophile, and an alcoholic. An extremely bad alcoholic. I saw him every so often, but I was never really *that* attached to him. I live(d) with my mother, step-dad, and some siblings. He wasn't really a part of anything. So a few years back, when I was 12, he went out to the desert in Arizona and killed himself. When I heard the news I cried about as hard as I would if I scraped my knee. Nothing really changed. After this happened, my mother noticed something about me; I was a lot like my father. I took up playing guitar (which I found out later was one of his favorite things), and started listening to music (which, coincidentally I ended up liking the same bands as he did, without even knowing it. Turns out we both really like the Rolling Stones). I inherited some physical attributes similar to his as well, such as my hair type and whatnot. This made me nervous about two things: alcohol and suicide. I've already decided that alcohol is never, ever going to be a part of my life. Not to say I'll never drink, but I've read that alcoholism can be genetic, and I want to avoid that road as much as possible. This brings me to the other thing: suicide.Now, my father was obviously quite depressed. He probably drank to cover his depression. Now, my mother is also quite depressed, but she's on antidepressants and she doesn't drink or anything. That means I have depression on both sides of my family.I just want to know if these things put me at an increased risk of depression, suicidal tendencies, etc. I know there's not much to do about it if it does, but I still wanna know. **tl;dr: dad killed himself and I'm lots like my dad.

I've held a loaded gun and contemplated it, but it wasn't like I didn't want to live. I was just indifferent.Anyway, these days I have a great life, or at least that's what I tell myself.

I really have a great life, and I keep telling myself I can't say I'm not happy, because I have so much. But lately... It's been fucked up.My whole life I was told by my family how smart I am, how my grades meant I was intelligent. I entered Engineering school, as mentioned, which in my country is kinda hard, but now I can't keep up. My grades are amongst the lowest. I haven't had true appetite for food for a few weeks. I only feel any joy around my friends and girlfriend, and even then, when they're telling stories, I always feel really bad because my life has been so uneventful. When they were going to parties, I was home on the Internet. My family can only be described as dysfunctional, and I don't trust them for almost anything(with reason).  Right now, I've stopped studying because I didn't know something. My tests are tomorrow and after. I turned off my phone to see if my gf will call me, and thus, call her attention, even though I don't tell her how I truly feel. I'm just sitting in the dark watching time goes by, not even music lights me up right now. It's not that I want to die, it's just I want to skip to a better time in life. A time when I'm not a house-staying boring nerd anymore.The only time I truly feel well is when I make someone happy. As in, not making people laugh,something cute for my gf. I mean getting the homeless some food, helping an old lady carry her bags randomly, take a blind man to his bus stop across the bus terminal.

But something is. I've been obsessed with crazy thoughts for a while. A lot of anxiety. Very strange thoughts. They don't make sense at all and I'm probably the only person in the world who has these specific thoughts. The thoughts itself make me anxious. For thinking about them. For simply having them. And for being unable to avoid them. I also feel like I think about everything. Every detail. I remember everything. _PERSON_ focused on every single thing I do. How it feels. When I use my laptop, I think about all the components it's made of and I think of scary thoughts like ""if the laptop breaks now, I'd have to buy a new one and I barely have enough money"".I'm also obsessed with hygiene. To an extreme. People eating in my house annoys me greatly. When they leave crumbs or don't wash their hands after eating something like pizza, I go insane. I also don't like people going in my room and I feel like I go mad when people use my laptop or something else I generally use. I can't explain why...My hands also tend to get a tiny bit sweaty when I'm using the laptop and this also greatly causes me anxiety. I don't wash my hands for germs, but because I feel like they're always sweaty. And I'm hesitant to touch anything when they're like that. My face also gets really oily so I have to wash it several times a day. When I touch my face and I see my finger is oily from face, I get great anxiety and have to wash face asap :(The worst thought however is the most crazy one. I don't remember exactly how it started but I imagine everything has a ""stutter"". Yeah, that sounds crazy doesn't it? Moving my eyes around, I imagine there's some micro stuttering or something like that. As if I ""feel"" something while looking... some kind of detail. Same with movement or touching. I can think there is a stutter while walking. Touching an object. Typing. My heart beating. Even music. Anything basically. This causes me great anxiety. It isn't logical at all... but I keep ""looking"" for it. Like the thought won't go away. It's like I summon the thought myself when it's gone because I have to feel it again... just to be sure. It's like fighting a losing battle. The fact it can happen anywhere and ith anything is probably the biggest reason I'm afraid.I really don't know what to do.

Here is a basic run-down of what advice I got from myself:""Dude, listen, from what you're saying, life is full of guessing games and 'what-ifs' about the future.

I'm here to tell you that, just as you don't know it won't get better, you sure as fuck don't know if it will. You think negatively and say 'All of this won't get better, ever. I'm not going anywhere, my life is shit and there's no other way out. I will never succeed, be successful, happy or feel needed, ever.' Take that into consideration, man, and now think about this for a second: You don't know for a fact things will stay this way, so what about thinking about the opposite for a change? What if everything, all of your dreams and hopes, came true? What if the love of your life comes through for you and treats you like it's heaven on earth? What if you become massively happy and successful to no ends and live a life that's just so vast, pure and beautiful that when you look back on this horrible moment, you can finally think to yourself 'I cannot believe I almost gave up on such a wonderful odyssey.' What if your life becomes absolutely brilliant and full of wonder? What if? Life is a gamble, man, and you know what, think of it as nothing but a giant casino, full of prizes and rigged with crap, because, it is.

So here goes:My closest friend is currently suffering from depression and severe anxiety, it's got to the stage now where I feel for his safety because he is regularly self-harming. Just this week he lost his temper in front of his girlfriend and proceeded to hit his head on the steering wheel of his car until he drew blood. He says that he's trying to get help but I have no idea whether this is actually true. Allegedly, he is currently on antidepressants and is seeing a counsellor.He acts completely normally around our mutual friends, he goes out drinking, he smokes weed and generally does everything that he used to do before he started becoming ill. He's essentially leading a double life, because on one hand he's severely depressed, and on the other he acts as if nothing is wrong.On several occasions I've had conversations with him about his depression but it always seems as if he's just saying what he thinks I want to hear. He regularly lies about his situation, acts like nothing is wrong and says he's trying his hardest to get on the right track.I'm at the point now where I cannot keep waiting for something to bad to happen (i.e. him accidentally killing himself) and I feel that I need to act. On another note, he's parents aren't aware of the severity of his situation and don't seem to be able to help in any way at all.Also, I reside in the UK and the NHS doesn't seem to have any advice for me, NHS direct just tell me that he needs to help himself and go to counsellors/his general practitioner but I can't trust him to do that.Does anyone know what I can do to help him? Does anyone have any experience in a situation like this?I feel out of my depth and I just want some guidance so I can move forward and help out my friend in the long term.TL;DR: A friend of mine is severely depressed and a danger to himself, how can I get him on the right track?",A Question About Mental Health,reddit moment bit tight spot decided write text post site advice life find advice friends parents close acquaintances trust closest friend suffering depression severe anxiety stage feel safety regularly harming week lost temper front girlfriend proceeded hit head steering wheel car drew blood idea true allegedly antidepressants counsellor acts completely mutual friends drinking smokes weed generally started ill essentially leading double life hand severely depressed acts wrong occasions conversations depression thinks hear regularly lies situation acts wrong hardest track point waiting bad happen accidentally killing feel act note parents aware severity situation reside uk nhs advice nhs direct counsellors general practitioner trust experience situation feel depth guidance move forward friend long term tl dr friend mine severely depressed danger track,question mental health,5.0,404.0,0.3421146315414739,0.0,2.833213344056216,1.4337689649119538,1.0,120

112,20841,"Back in 2009, my mom was fired from her job after working there for a decade. It was over some HIPAA privacy issues. A coworker, lets call her _PERSON_ mentioned that _PERSON_ had a UT problem. She then non-maliciously looked it up using her professional access. She's been around these people for a decade, they worked together in a close-proximity, and they are very close emotionally, so something personal like this wouldn't be an issue among them. However, some trouble-making person, lets call her _PERSON_, told a higher up and because of this technical infraction, she had to be fired. I don't think she understands that it was a pure technicality, in fact I know she doesn't understand that. I used to go to her job when I was in elementary and middle school when I had to do surveys and interviews for school. They are a professional sisterhood. So for some reason or another, she has taken the firing personally and still believes it is some character fault of hers or something. No one wanted her gone, except for _PERSON_, not even the boss that fired her.I helped her find another job less than a year later where she has been working ever since. Her effervescent personality had survived the firing and she has talked about her days at her new office often over the years. She laughs as she tells us about notable events and personalities at the office. It has been that way since 2009, but I've always suspected that underneath all the laughter she is still depressed. She has mentioned a few times over the years that she thinks about jumping in front of the train (I live in a major city). And she mentioned it again today while my parents have been having a little quarrel.This is what I don't get. Neither of these events were/are personal, but she takes it personally. She doesn't work in an administrative capacity, so she can't feel responsible for the establishment closing. We have been financially worse when I was younger so it can't be a shocking change. Even when she had no job for a period of seven months, we didn't have any serious financial burdens. We are better off today since my brother also has a career now. I don't know of any practical difference since her departure from her first job, and I doubt there will be any practical difference this time around. In regards to the current situation, maybe I'm too young to understand how an establishment's financial failure can have such an emotional impact unless I myself have emotionally invested a great deal on its success (like if it was my own business). Does a job ending have the same impact regardless of the reasons surrounding its end? That seems silly.She doesn't walk around listlessly either. Occasional moping, but every human does that. My family on the whole is humorous and we share laughs often. My dad is a little abrasive, but there is love between them. We are a pretty emotionally healthy family. I don't communicate personal things, like my distaste of their religious beliefs, or other things, but how many young adults can?I don't doubt that what she feels and has expressed is real to her, but when I think about it, I have no empathy for her reasoning. None of her job issues have been personal, so who cares? And this is why I feel bad. I do not have any sympathy and it scares me. And losing her would confuse me. What should I say when she fleetingly mentions her suicidal thoughts? Should I even try to say anything? My current reaction has been just to stay quiet.Thank you for reading.","My mom's place of work is closing due to its financial failure, but because of the past she thinks she's depressed and fleetingly mentions suicide.",back mom fired job working decade hipaa privacy issues coworker lets call person mentioned person ut problem maliciously looked professional access people decade worked close proximity close emotionally personal issue trouble making person lets call person told higher technical infraction fired understands pure technicality fact understand job elementary middle school surveys interviews school professional sisterhood reason firing personally believes character fault wanted person boss fired helped find job year working effervescent personality survived firing talked days office years laughs tells notable events personalities office suspected underneath laughter depressed mentioned times years thinks jumping front train live major city mentioned today parents quarrel events personal takes personally work administrative capacity feel responsible establishment closing financially worse younger shocking change job period months financial burdens today brother career practical difference departure job doubt practical difference time current situation young understand establishment financial failure emotional impact emotionally invested great deal success business job ending impact reasons surrounding end silly walk listlessly occasional moping human family humorous share laughs dad abrasive love pretty emotionally healthy family communicate personal things distaste religious beliefs things young adults doubt feels expressed real empathy reasoning job issues personal cares feel bad sympathy scares losing confuse fleetingly mentions suicidal thoughts current reaction stay quiet reading,mom place work closing due financial failure past thinks depressed fleetingly mentions suicide,25.0,621.0,0.1761926535589086,0.0,2.833213344056216,1.4268476767652027,1.0,206
114,21174,"Going into my last year in high school's been tough, for about the past 6 years, the thought of killing myself has become more and more realistic.  starting off with the bad experience's would probably be a start I guess.  When I was about 5 until the time I was about 7, I was sexually abused by an older family friend, I had know what was going on the entire time and had developed a bit of a distrust to people at that point and have been shy since that day.  It's been pretty scaring for me to have to not open up to people really until now.Fast forwarding a couple years, constantly being bullied all throughout elementary/junior high school, even the start of high school.  I never felt quite in with the crowd and it made me distrust people more, become depressed and become pissed off with the world that I was living in.  I took to being friends with a few select people and constantly being an ass to others, due to the fact that I knew they were just trying to piss me off.  The situation at home was also very bad.  The only one in my household whom actually treated me with decency was my brother, whom to this day I have the best relationship with out of my entire family.  My parents were very violent and would constantly yell/beat me,  sometimes almost to the point of hospitalization/death.  I always hated living at home and vowed to either kill myself(which I have attempted many times before, couldn't follow through with it) or just live my life through and just move out ASAP and try to live life.  after my parents getting a divorce, things got much better for the beatings/violence,  mainly due to the huge custody battle my parents were in.  They tried to be as nice as possible and get me whatever I wanted(for the most part), yet all I wanted was an apology for their actions when I was younger and to truly accept me as their son.  neither would listen and continued to be completely ignorant.  To settle the whole custody arrangement, my parents thought it would be a good idea for me to go see a counselor to try to sort out my feelings.  During one of the counselor meetings, we were discussing a lot of things in the past, with arguments and how unfair my parents were.  My dad lied out his ass and tried to make him look like he was the victim the entire time, yet my mom had openly apologized for all the things she did and how she was wrong to take out her stress on us.  It was pretty much then that I moved in permanently with my mom.  That was about 2 years ago, since then, I had torn my ACL, as well as causing major meniscus damage  resulting in not being able to be active for the past year and a half, a very painful surgery, long term physiotherapy as well as depression.  I still cannot run properly or even play sports which was a big part of my life.  It's been very rough for me this past year and I fear for the worst when it comes to suicide, I feel as though I am alone in my feelings, although I know others go through the same things daily.","I have been suicidal for years, don't know what to do now",year high school tough past years thought killing realistic starting bad experience start guess time sexually abused older family friend entire time developed bit distrust people point shy day pretty scaring open people fast forwarding couple years constantly bullied elementary junior high school start high school felt crowd made distrust people depressed pissed world living friends select people constantly ass due fact knew piss situation home bad household treated decency brother day relationship entire family parents violent constantly yell beat point hospitalization death hated living home vowed kill attempted times follow live life move asap live life parents divorce things beatings violence due huge custody battle parents nice wanted part wanted apology actions younger accept son listen continued completely ignorant settle custody arrangement parents thought good idea counselor sort feelings counselor meetings discussing lot things past arguments unfair parents dad lied ass make victim entire time mom openly apologized things wrong stress pretty moved permanently mom years ago torn acl causing major meniscus damage resulting active past year half painful surgery long term physiotherapy depression run properly play sports big part life rough past year fear worst suicide feel feelings things daily,suicidal years,12.0,588.0,0.3786982248520709,0.0,3.332204510175204,1.2011792984564575,1.0,192

119,21999,"I had a few things left in life. My computer. My girlfriend. And /r/buildapc. What started as therapeutical... May be what finally pushes me. I started building computers because I needed a hobby, and my therapist said it would give me some self worth if I used what I know to help other people. So I made this account, I subbed to all of the computer subreddits, and I started helping. I did all that I could. But... I'm an emotional wreck, and I get too anxious and get too mad and people react horribly, which I guess I deserve. Now, my PC is having problems I can't fix, I'm out of money, my computer building business has gone to shit, and I'm scared to admit that. I worked hard on it and now it's going away. My girlfriend loves me but she can't help me. Everything I worked up to, what I thought was making my life okay, is... Going. I think its time that I go. Ive already attempted suicide twice, 6th grade after I couldn't handle the abuse at home and the bullying at school and the residual effects of being raped for years... and 10th grade over a lost girlfriend and the problems and changes that accompany that, as well as the work that piled up over the whole year that I was too depressed to do...I'm not on any meds anymore. I don't want to be. They don't help. Nothing helps. Nothing will ever be right. Nothing will ever be okay. Everything I create will eventually be destroyed, and in the vast expansion of time, I'm just a blip, and I think it may be time for me to go. I'm 18 and I have had enough of life. When I leave my girlfriends, I may crash my car. I don't know. I'll probably pussy out and not do it again. I may say goodbye soon everyone. I can't handle the pain. It's been there my whole life and I want to be the one who takes it away I'm sorry I have been suicidal for a very... very long time, and to cut the story short, it was mostly related to my parents and their abuse. I will be graduating this week, and I decided not to walk. I hated highschool. It was the worst four years of my life. I wanted to die every day. I kept girlfriends to give me a giant reason not to kill myself. I finally got my shit together this year after a girl I started dating sophomore year recognized me as a human being and not worthless trash of a sibling/son, and her family accepted me. But, I still live with my family. I worked really hard this year to get shit done, and it used to take a mountain of encouragement to get out of bed or brush my teeth, let alone the awful day that followed. My family doesnt give a shit. They blamed their problems on me for having bad grades, saying it was stressful to them even though my grades were all fine, until eventually I stopped fighting it and REALLY let them tank (I had single digit grade averages in multiple classes) and really let myself go. I gained 30 pounds, let my teeth gap out again after getting braces off, and pretty much lived in my room drinking and getting high to curb the intense depression. But now, like i said, im graduating and ive finally made it, but now im not going to college because it would put my family in debt. Instead of paying for my college, they bought my sister a car at the end of her graduation at college.

121,22015,"I apologize in advance for this being so long. I just couldn't stop typing.I want to die.I’ve done nothing, and I’m going nowhere. I know I’m going nowhere because the second I’m put under pressure, I crack and fall apart at the seams.Everyone thinks I’m this wonderful person and all I can do is hate myself. All I can feel is that they must be lying to me. I’m not smart, I’m not athletic, the only thing I would even consider myself remotely talented in is art, and we all know how far that shit takes you in life. I love science, but I’m probably just throwing myself into a field that I’m going to drown. The study I love, Virology, means likely trying to go for a PHD. I’m fooling myself if I think I can get that far. Just last year I nearly committed suicide from pushing myself to try to be in AP classes. I needed to keep improving myself, I needed to be smarter. Instead all I did was fall apart and had to be taken out of all of them half-way through the year and put into honors classes. My GPA was ruined, I failed one of my classes, and the thought of doing a problem on the board in front of everyone sends me into panic attacks. Instead I watched as my smart, well-adjusted friends were able to pull through and do well. Now it feels like I’m in a different world. All I can think is that they must see me pass in the hallway and think, “Remember her? She used to have such a promising future.”All I can think is that they must feel I didn’t try hard enough. After all, if they could do it, why shouldn’t I be able to? I have lost over the years my best friend. My first real friend. She lied to me twice- the first time it hurt, but I accepted it and tried to forgive. The second time was over the same issue, and felt like a knife in my stomach. And she knows I have trust issues ever since my parents divorced. She apologized for it once, and proceeded to try to act as though it never happened. If I even mentioned that I had been hurt by it, she would get sulky and say she *had* apologized, even if I barely remember it. So then I would feel guilty. When I tried to open up about how I felt when I was sad, it would immediately turn into essentially a dick-measuring contest of who’s sadder. But I still remember the nights we would spend watching LOST and stay up late talking about philosophy and books and, well, anything. I miss her so much, but I don’t even recognize her anymore. I feel I could never trust her again. We haven’t talked in months. And I know if I was to go to her and tell her all of this- she would immediately get defensive and deny everything. So I would shut up. Again.Like every fucking day.I hate my body. I hate it so much. The sponginess, the softness of it, the roundness- it’s absolutely sick and disgusting. My grandpa keeps acting as though calling me an attractive young woman is a compliment, despite knowing full well I’m attending therapy for transgender issues. When I point this out to him, he simply says, “Well, YOU ARE. It’s not like I’m going to LIE to you.” I suppose I’m lucky I’m afraid of pain, else I would have started self-harming years ago. The thought is tempting though. Sometimes I fantasize that my breasts are like large, disgusting zits and I can pop them like one. Or if I take a knife and make a slit from the underside, I’ll be able to just squeeze out pus and blood until it’s all out and I have a flat chest. When no one is around I try to move my chest in front of the microwave as much as possible in the hopes that it’s not an urban myth and that I can give myself breast cancer. Other times I’m convinced I can cut off my own skin. Just peel it off like a wetsuit. More than once I’ve considered actually trying it, peeling off this female skin and being able to see the real me underneath it. There’s nothing underneath though but blood, sinew and bone.Then there’s the fact that though I feel like a man, I am not very manly. At all. I am such a fucking girl it’s downright pathetic. How could anyone take me seriously when lately I cry at the drop of a hat? I’m weak, into arts and drama and know nothing about fishing, cars, sports, and my emotions swing back and forth like a pendulum. The moment I even start to feel confidant and as though that doesn’t really matter… well, let me just try to quote my grandfather on that. “Dramatic_pause, you don’t know *what* you want yet. Your grandfather has been around and gays and transgenders-“ disclaimer, he’s the type that predates a sexist remark with, ‘I have nothing against women!’ “- and worked with them before, and I’ve talked to doctors too. If you were really… *like that*, we would have seen signs earlier. I haven’t seen anything like that, and your grandfather is a smart whip.”Great.

She and her siblings were the closest things I had to siblings until my brother came along when I was 11. One of her brothers died back in '99 (car accident) and that about broke me. Now this. She is the second cousin I've lost to hanging themselves. I keep staring off, feeling numb, and then I start bawling.

126,24226,"Four years ago I was 19 and I was living 10 hours away from all of my family and friend. I wish in my freshman year of college and was stretching myself thin. At the time this took place I was taking 6 classes and was involved in the theatre so my time was limited. I had been battling with depression for years but never told anyone about it. I felt that I had nothing to be depressed about. I had a good family, a nice place to live, my intelligence and a small group of good friends but I never felt like I really connected to people. I went so far away to school to remake myself in hopes that it would help.It didn't.One night in October, I had enough. I was done. Nothing really set this off. I had one friend and I was dating someone at the time but I didn't see the point in going on. My roommate was gone (I lived in a dorm and we shared a room) so I proceeded to down a bottle of pills. I laid down thinking ""Well, this is it"" and went to sleep.4 hours later I woke up and ran to the bathroom. I spent the next 6 hours with my head in a toilet. Once morning hit (about 8am) I texted my boyfriend and told him I was sick and he called campus police who drove me to the hospital. I was checked in and when they asked what happened I told them I blacked out. I must have lied well enough in that they didn't think it was a suicide attempt. They made me drink this foul tasting stuff to help my liver filter out the pills and the next day I was back at my dorm. About 5 hours later they called and said poison control said I needed to come back in for more medication. I was in for another night receiving medication and getting my blood drawn to test my liver. Once I was cleared, I was out of the hospital and back to my dorm. A few weeks later, I told my friend and boyfriend what really happened and they urged me to get help.I went to the college's counseling center after a few other people had told me they wouldn't push drugs (I was very against them). I went and filled out a ton of forms that I thought were completely idiotic.After she read the forms she said that she wasn't trained to handle cases like mine and referred me to a psychiatrist. I went to meet with him 3 days later and he diagnosed me with Major Depression. He said that while talking would help, my problems were chemical and that I needed medication. After a couple weeks of resisting the meds, I relented and got the prescription filled. My initial dose screwed me up. I was irritable, anxious and it made my depression much worse. He said that if I was having any running thoughts (I was) or suicidal ideas (I was) to call him ASAP so I did. He said to go the hospital and let them know who he was and who I was. They immediately put me on suicide watch but because I wasn't manic or out-of-control, they didn't lock me in the room. They let me sleep there and the next morning they put me on a gurney and strapped me down.The next thing I know I'm being transported to a mental health facility about an hour an a half away. I was there for 3 days. Because I was 19 I was legally an adult and they put me with all of the adults in the center. Emotionally, I was not an adult at all. I was mostly with drug addicts but we did see a few clinically insane people. My first day I cried. I was considered a risk to myself so I couldn't check myself out and I had a major panic attack when they told me I couldn't leave.The second day, I played the game. I did what they wanted me to do-I went to group meetings, I listened to what the doctors and nurses said. But something odd happened.  As I was playing along, I realized things were actually helping. The ""stupid"" activities were actually making me feel better. I'm smart enough to know what they were doing so I thought I was above it but it worked.Two days later I was released and sent back to school. I went back to the psychiatrist and yelled at him a bit for telling me to go to the hospital and at the end of my rant, I cried and thanked him. He lowered the dose on my meds and that stopped the problems I was having.Flash forward 4 years later. I'm still on my meds-I've attempted to go off them or change them but nothing works as well as they do and without them, I go back to being the depressed teenager I was.I'm now married and have 1 year old twin girls. I do worry about what my girls are going to think about me needing medication to be a normal human being but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.I don't believe meds are always the answer and I don't believe that everyone should go spend a few days in a psych ward, but it worked for me. Hopefully every one of you will realize that there is something out there for you. Please don't do what I did. It's the only thing in my life I'm happy I failed at.

127,24255,"There has been alot of change in my life recently and i recently stopped taking all of my meds except 2. But the big issue is recently i have been wanting to kill myself. The only reason i havent is because i dont want to abandon my boyfriend. It wouldnt be fair to him. I just really don't know what to do. In general my life is very lonely and i can't take beinng sad anymore it feels like its getting physically painful and my heart  feels like it's heavy in my chest. I think i have friends but i'm not sure they really are there for me. And recently a very complicated friendship of mine ended and this other person just ignored me completly out of no where and i tried and tried to atleast get some sort of ""i dont want to speak to you anymore"" or some final good bye because since then it just feels like it opened up every history of being rejected and feeling less than. I just wanted to be okay. I know there is no ""normal"" but i know the way i am and how i react to issues and people isnt how other people are. I used to pride myself on being different thinking that the way i was fueled my artistic views but now in my 20's im not sure whats real and whats not. Im tired of all the medicine of rejection of fucking up and failing and hating what i see in the  mirror and who i am i really want to give up and only my boyfriend is who i have keeping me and the relationship may not be so healthy. But if i didnt have him i would gladly go and never look back i want to go away and be forgotten forever because it hurts too much and i don't want this any more. I hope i feel better, i probably will at some point eventually. If not i swear im sorry but im too sensitive and i dont want to be here any more. Last night i tried to kill myself with a scalpel from my disection kit. Ofcourse i failed because i guess the blade was not sharp enough or i was to weak. I am bluntly one of the people in the world who loves with everything in them but has never had that unconditional love in return. Not from my significant other, not from my parents or my friends. I have people who can be defined as friends but i may not mean to then as they do to me. I have developed a twitch recently from my medication. I thought that was the cause of what has been going on but viibryd actual cleared my mind enough to study and funtion but in seeing reality i saw that i was not loved. I always thought so but i hoped so much that it was a delusion but it wasn't. I want the simple things in life. To one day have a decent job, have the gift of giving life and have a genuine smile perhaps once a day. For now i have scars all over my wrist that i will have to hide to not be judged or pitied and the knowledge of knowing that one night i tried my hardest to return to the stars and leave this planet. I hope you all have a much better time that i. I hope you realize that if there are people who love u love them back like hell. Love them as is you will never be able to love again because its something everyone should have and unfortunately there are people that will never know that.",i need help very bad Returning to star stuff,alot change life recently recently stopped taking meds big issue recently wanting kill reason nt nt abandon boyfriend nt fair general life lonely beinng sad anymore feels physically painful heart feels heavy chest friends recently complicated friendship mine ended person completly atleast sort nt speak anymore final good bye feels opened history rejected feeling wanted normal react issues people nt people pride thinking fueled artistic views real tired medicine rejection fucking failing hating mirror give boyfriend keeping relationship healthy nt gladly back forgotten forever hurts hope feel point eventually swear sensitive nt night kill scalpel disection kit ofcourse failed guess blade sharp weak bluntly people world loves unconditional love return significant parents friends people defined friends developed twitch recently medication thought viibryd actual cleared mind study funtion reality loved thought hoped delusion wasn simple things life day decent job gift giving life genuine smile day scars wrist hide judged pitied knowledge knowing night hardest return stars leave planet hope time hope realize people love love back hell love love people,bad returning star stuff,4.5,314.0,0.2135938641344047,1.0,2.3513752571634776,1.3881279808231144,2.0,170
128,24836,"I'm sitting here, thinking, crying. I asked 'do you still want me?' you replied 'i think so..' That really hurt..The things that are running through my mind are: He will find someone better; you are a failure; you can't do anything right; why me; how could you say that; he is better off without me... I know you can see all of this. And I want to say I'm sorry. For everything, i wish our fights weren't so bad, because other than that, everything is perfect. I still have strong feelings for you and I don't want you to leave. You are my life, without you I'm lost, and without you I'm nothing. I miss you and you haven't even left. I want you to be happy with me because I am happy with you. I want to be the only girl you love. My depression is ruining our relationship, and know I want to die because its all my fault. I don't know what to say anymore, I'm out of words, but not tears. I'm sorry, for everything. But ill never stop having feelings for you. You are the best. Okay so recently my ex(m 17) and I broke up with me (f 16). I was with him for a year and almost 9 months. In that time both of my parents died and my only grandparent left. He was always there for me, but after my moms death(the most recent) he changed. He would just sit on craigslist when we hung out. I would try to get him to go places with me instead of sitting there, which he refused. He started fighting with me more, and calling my a bitch in every fight. Things weren't the same but i still loved the old him. So a week before we broke up he wouldn't touch me, hug me, kiss me, cuddle with me, he would avoid hanging out with me, and when i got naked in front of him and tried to get him excited he would just push me off.. I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what. Now I know that he was having other feelings for another girl, he didn't tell me this i had to find out the hard way. A couple of days before we broke up we got in a fight over text message while he was at work.. so i drove in there to say 'hey lets stop fighting i love you' Well he took me on a delivery and said 'You are ruining my social life' i said 'Well who do you want to hang out with' ' the girls from work, they asked me out drinking and i said no I cant because of kim' ok first of all when your in a relationship you should go out drinking with all girls...plus he hates drinking he would even do it with me. and hey here is an idea, you could always invite me. So after he told me that, i broke down on the way home, I always fuck everything up, I shouldn't be alive. So then we broke up, come to find out he had told his dad 'we were fuck buddies,' oh okay thanks..And also the day after we broke up he was texting the girl from his work that almost broke us up multiple times.. here are some other reddits i've posted right after the break up:  _URL_ I hate myself more and more everyday, because I was the problem..Now he blocked me on facebook, wont talk to me, wont check up on me(even tho I'm very suicidal) so he doesn't care about me, and I can see why.. But now I miss him more than ever, I have all of the stuff he gave me and last night I had a dream about how we used to be happy, I woke up crying. I know people will always say, its ok move on you'll find someone better.. Well when we were happy he was always looking forward to spending the future with me. I miss everything, all of the cuddling and when he used to make dumb faces. I miss all the passionate kisses. I miss the old him. Now I'm just lost, because I gave up all of my friends to be with him. He had made all of those friends when he got a job, and I just sit here alone. All the people I want to hangout with have girlfriends, and my best friend is a long ways away. I hate making new friends when I need someone because I feel needy. I miss him, but I'm the one who fucked up everything. All I do is sit at home, cry a lot, sometimes cut,  and I cant eat because I'll throw up. I'm better off dead, I just need to die, but I want him to find me..so then maybe he will miss me back.. I thought everything was finally starting to get better, and now I'm just back at the bottom. Crying, cutting, and suicidal thoughts.. I'm not good for anything. My old best friend told me he was really falling for me, but doesn't ever make an effort to talk to me. We had sex, now he just ignores me. Thanks, fuck you too. I'm better off gone, to end all of this frustration and hurt. Why the fuck am I still here. Why haven't i taken all my pills, or cut so deep that I'm passed out on my bedroom floor bleeding to death..I am sick of getting hurt, loosing people and people leaving me. It's bullshit. I'm a failure. I should die, I'm better off. I guess I should start thinking about it. I want to end this pain, but I don't know whats holding me back from not overdosing this very second.","I don't need to be here.. I'm better off dead.

129,25368,"Okay well I don’t really like talking about myself but since you all are nice enough to read this I guess I'll share some personal things with you guys…I don’t know how to really start but I guess I’ll try by explaining my various issues…The number one issue for my depression is that I hate myself, so in other words, my low self-esteem. I look in the mirror and see the reflection and I’m just disgusted. I’m ugly, fat, stupid, and their is no one who could ever like a person like me.I’ve cut for the past four years of my life off and on. It has gotten significantly worse these past two years though. I used to cut maybe once of twice a week, and now its almost everyday.I think about killing myself everyday. Every morning when I wake-up, if something bad happens during the day, and before I go to bed. Before I fall asleep at night I pray that I won’t wake-up in the morning. That all the pain and all the suffering will be over, and I’ll be gone. The people in my life will move on and act as if I was never here. No one will care, and everyone’s lives will be a lot easier. My parents, my few _PERSON_ you can even call them that), and my boyfriend. I’ve had multiple attempts aswell. Planned it all out, left suicide notes, ready to do it, but well as you can see, unfortunately I’m still alive.My number two reason is my mother…She blames me for ALL the stress in her life…She blames me for things that happen at her office, like if one of her employee’s fuck up she’ll compare me to them and say that I’m just like them!She calls me stupid, lazy, worthless and that I’ll never amount to anything in life.If she doesn’t like the clothes that I’m wearing she’ll tell me I look like a prostitute…She blames me for her having _PERSON_ I’m sorry I fucking shoved sugar down your throat….?!)The number three reason is that my parents put a lot of restrictions on me. I’m 18 and I’m not allowed to go anywhere. Even if I want to go see a movie or go for coffee with one of my friends I have to ask for permission, which is pointless because they always say no anyways.I get no independence. I get no life. They suffocate me. I HAVE to work in their office; I am not allowed to get any other job. This is so they can keep an eye on me, and see what I am doing at all times. I am not allowed to take my cell phone to work or keep it in my room when I get home. I forgot to mention that I pay for this phone myself.My number four reason is my boyfriend. I care and love him a lot so don’t get me wrong or anything, but I just feel like I’m always doing something wrong in our relationship, or I’m stressing him out with all my “drama”. I just feel like he wants to break-up with me. He constantly tells me that this is not the case and that he does not want a break-up. I just feel like he deserves someone better than me. Someone who’s smarter, prettier, and will give him everything he wants/needs in a relationship.I just don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I don’t know where I’m going or what is going to happen to me. I’m really scared… Hey guys, so this is the original post: _URL_ its taken me three months or so to work up the courage and actually see someone, but today I finally had my first appointment with my psychiatrist. I can honestly say that I felt so good being able to say out loud the problems that I've kept bottled up inside. It was so nice to talk to someone about it and actually get help! :DShe has decided to start me on medication right away. She's starting me on Viibryd which is like Lexapro.Does anyone know about this medication? If so, what are your comments about it? So... this is an update on how my life is going now... Original post is from about 5 months ago: _URL_ first statement I'll start off by saying is that I have finally been diagnosed with Major _PERSON_ aswell as severe anxiety and I might have ADD:?*UPDATE* I haven't cut for the past few months now.I used to think about killing myself everyday. Every morning when I woke-up, if something bad happened during the day, and before I went to bed. Before I fell asleep at night I would pray that I wouldn't wake-up in the morning. I just wanted all the pain and all the suffering to be over, and I'd be gone from the world. The people in my life would move on and act as if I was never there. No one would care, and everyone's lives would be a lot easier. My parents, my few _PERSON_ you can even call them that), and my boyfriend. I've had multiple attempts aswell. Planned it all out, left suicide notes, ready to do it, but well as you can see, unfortunately I'm still alive.*UPDATE*: About 2 weeks ago I jumped out of my 2nd story bedroom window. I'm okay though, I wanted to die but I couldn't get up higher. My left ankles sprained but everything else is fine. My depression medication _PERSON_ is working really well, and I love my anxiety medication _PERSON_ its fucking amazing. I feel so calm and at piece with my surroundings and I don't get tense, anxious, or have any racing thoughts so its great! :DBoyfriend and I broke-up but I'm doing really well.

130,25479,"My marriage is 'recovering' but I still feel lower than worthless. Despite any improvement, reassurance, or promise I still can't stop feeling that my wife valued her relationship with someone she met four times over our eight year relationship. I still think every night about how after I told her I wanted to end it and didn't want to, or trust myself to be alone that she left me to see him.I understand intrusive thoughts better than most, but knowing that   part of her would be happy if I was gone robs me of any motivation to get better. To know that I'm no longer attractive to her, that she would essentially decide our lives together or apart on a coin flip leaves me feeling completely abandoned by the only person I've ever loved this much. She made me promise I wouldn't do it, and I thought it was because she cared, now I just feel like she doesn't want to deal with the guilt and I don't know if that's a good enough reason to keep my promise.

131,25499,"I can't do this any more. I don't even know why if I'm being entirely honest - I just got out of hospital for depression a week ago, and I'm already suicidal again. Got out feeling on top of the world, and now I'm back down at the bottom. Normally going into hospital gets me a few months of happiness before I end up back in there, but now? Now I can't even get a full week. What the hell is the point any more? My anxiety is so intense that I can't even make it out the door for anything more than a walk each day, and I can barely do that because I'm too out of shape to do anything more than 2km. The anxiety is also stopping me from even attending outpatients at the hospital, so fuck that avenue too. I can't even get support from professionals because I'm too damn nervous to get out the door and catch a train down there.I'm just sick of it. Sick of feeling like a no-hoper who's gonna be stuck living off welfare for the rest of his life because of the anxiety (it's considered bad enough that I'm on a disability pension) sick of not being able to study because I have fuck all concentration, sick of not being able to get a girlfriend, or even new friends, because I can't leave the house. I'm just... Sick of life.The only thing that's making me hesitate is the fact that my mother suffers from depression as well, and I worry that I may tip her over the edge if I do anything, same goes for my best friend. But... that motivation to keep living is getting thinner and thinner. I don't even know if I want to be persuaded, but I figure that for their sake, I should try Ugh, I'm posting here because I don't know who else to turn to. I have friends who know about my depression and are supportive, as well as family, but if I tell them how close I am to taking all those pills, chances are I'll be back in hospital within a week and I'll have the pills taken away from me and hidden. That's the last thing I want to happen right now, because I feel like the only actual option I have in my life right now is that of suicide - I don't want that one option to be taken away from me. Even if I choose not to commit suicide, I at least want to be ABLE to do it, if I should change my mind later. So I really don't want to tell my friends or family any of this.Thing is though, my parents are gone at the moment, so I'm alone in the house and my pills are accessible to me for the first time in about a year - normally my mum just hands out my daily doses and that's all I get. The fact that I can finally actually overdose like I've been considering for so long... it's so hard for me to resist right now.I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. It's not the thought of death that scares me, it's the thought that if I act on these thoughts, it'd tear my family apart, and I don't want to be responsible for that.But on the other hand, I'm so sick of being so anxious all the goddamn time, always being alone. Please help, somebody. I don't even know what I want, but... please help. I hesitate to even write this post, because it reeks of attention-seeking to write a suicide post 2 months before I'm even planning to do it, but I guess I want to be talked out of it, for the sake of my family.I've finally figured out my method, I've figured out what I'm writing in my note, how and when in the day I'm going to do it to minimize chances of being discovered. Basically, I'm just sick to death (hah) of all the anxiety and depression, of being in and out of hospital. I feel like a waste of space on this planet, not contributing anything to society, just taking a disability pension every fortnight because of severe anxiety that stops me functioning properly and being able to live a halfway decent life.I don't WANT to commit suicide, mainly because of my family, who I know will be devastated by it (especially because my mum already suffers from depression herself) but frankly, I'm just... sick of it. I figure I'll wait until February, mainly so I can last through Christmas. My mother LOVES Christmas, so I don't want to forever have that time of year affiliated with my death for her, and I'm planning to see my dad in another state one last time before I go, so that rules out the first half of January. Then I'm going back into hospital in the first half of Feb for an anxiety and depression program which, quite frankly, I can't see working. But I'll give it one last shot, and if it doesn't work, I guess I'll end it once and for all. Just wanted to get that off my chest. I've been wanting to tell somebody for a couple of weeks now, but anybody I know in real life would just try to put me in hospital again, which I really don't want. Thanks for reading, anybody who does.","Planning to do it tomorrow Have access to an assload of meds, trying very hard to resist overdosing...

Do you think I should be on suicide watch? Idk... I hate my life. I've been mad at the world lately for no reason. I hate my job. I hate myself. Tired of bottling shit in. I have trichotillomania (the irresistible urge to pluck out my own hair) disorder. No one knows until now because I've been able to hide it for 12 years but it's getting to where it's hard to conceal with what I have to work with. Tired of being stepped on talked down to judged and looked down upon. I don't want to be alive anymore. Well honestly I haven't wanted to be alive for about three years now. I've been taking anxiety medicine for about 5 months and when asked about what about depression I said none but after he asked me that I figured out I was born depressed. I was born weighing two pounds they had to attach me to machines and tubes and my mom said that I had took my pinky finger and yanked the tube out of my mouth. I was almost dead. I'm not supposed to be here. It's always been so severe and for so many years that I just been lying to myself that I was normal. I have tricked myself into believing that was happy because I simply cannot function when those feelings surface. My brain's ability to think straight shuts down. So I fool myself so I could carry on. I'd like to say I'm good at it.. Really good at it. Till now. My whole life is a lie. I know that now. My grandmother was a drug addict and crazy although she liked admitting to it my mom is crazy my uncle died from alcohol abuse my second cousin killed himself because he was tired of being pushed around because he was gay. I'm 24 and still living with my parents with no kids to be there for which gives me intensive but I think that's the only true reason I'm still here because my parents would be absolutely devastated.

137,26915,"First here is some perspective- I am 51 years of age and my son (2nd of 3) is 17- He is a senior in high school set to graduate in 4 months- Our first indications of something wrong came from the school councilor who was acting on advice of my son's friends- Our second indication was a call from the police at the hospital where he was being cared for after a call for help. (I don't know if that call was real or a euphemism but there were no physical indications of trauma)- I've been letting the professionals handle it with 2 notable exceptions. After the first incident, I had a very rewarding talk with him where he appeared to open up to me. I had 1 piece of advice that he appeared to accept which was - *don't tell anyone what you think they want to hear. No one can help you unless you tell the truth and talk about what is truly bothering you*. The second exception was related to some poor (my assessment) decisions he was making with respect to dropping a class a school. He wouldn't explain his reasoning and his mind was made up. I had a discussion about making decisions and explained that it was my role to guide him and if he is refusing to be led then he is forcing me to make decisions based on lack of information and that is never a good thing.- They second incident resulted in a spat with my wife and I decided to pull back, reluctantly.- That brings us to a month agoSo last night he has made arrangements to be with some of his football buddies for a party of sorts. He has asked for and received permission to stay over if the situation is such that he wants to. He's also borrowed the family van so that he can assume his role of designated driver for anyone who wants to go home and has been drinking. Yes, he was always up front about being at parties where alcohol was available and we trust him, or at least there has been no reason not to trust him. (Read:Don't like it but I've gotta let go sometime)So, around 2-3am he comes home. So far so good, he had an opportunity to stay over but made a different decision. I go back to sleep. 6 am I notice my wife is not in bed. I'll give you more point form as I don't think you want to read what's in my head- He's upset coming home- He reveals he didn't go to a party- Instead he met a girl that he met online in a town 1 hour away- He got a speeding ticket coming back- He knew he was busted but was hoping that I wouldn't find out- My wife is beside herself with worryA little more about me. When I was 18 and hosting a party at my house, I had an incident. It involved a loaded shotgun and were it not for the safety, I would not be writing this to you. As Forest Gump would say: That's all I'm gonna say about that. Further, my eldest brother is a diagnosed schizophrenic with manic depressive tendencies (Bipolar) and my elder brother has a non-diagnosed inferiority complex that severely interferes with his social skills. We are all above average in intelligence but feel undeserving of such. It is more of a curse than you know to be able to analyse things so well and self analyse so poorly.

141,27668,"Lets start nicely, shall we? I'm not going to kill myself. Four weeks ago, I finished my freshman year of college. I made friends, got great grades, and even got asked out. It wasn't a bad year. However, a *few* things were wrong... My parents, especially my dad, have been putting on the pressure to constantly be better at everything. They keep reminding me that I don't go to school to make friends... ""in a couple of years, you won't remember anyone you met at college"" ect. This is disheartening because I've never really had close friends before. Suddenly, I have people I care about, and I'm being told to not care. Also, I know I have detachment issues. I push people away, simply because I'm pretty private. I keep my emotions in check, and some people don't like that. This semester, I had a guy express interest in having a relationship with me, but he was put off by the fact that I didn't really *give* him the emotional response he was looking for. To add to the ""guy problems"", I don't know if I'm even interested in guys at all. I've always found girls more attractive, but I've never had any sexual experiences to sway me one way or the other. I'm 19, and I've never even kissed anyone else. Maybe asexual? My lack of experience isn't really bothersome, but rather the confusion associated with it. Anyway, I had minor problems while in school, but now that I'm home, things have gotten infinitely worse.  My parents just want me to get a job, and at this stage in my life, that's all I want too. I've applied so many different places, but I can't seem to even get a return call back from them. My resume is stacked, and I'm a very personable person. I've handed most of my apps in in-person, and I've followed up. After 4 weeks of looking for a stupid, min-wage summer job and having no result, I'm beginning to feel terrible about myself. Having a job was the only thing I had planned this summer, and so no I have no purpose. Also, I'm totally alone. I live in a really rural area where most of my friends live no closer than 15 minutes away by car. My best friend is currently 3 hours away, and will be the entire summer. Because I'm a detached person, I've dug myself into a hole, and have very few close friends at the moment. I'm alone 80% of the day, and when I'm around people, I tend to be irritable and angry, which is not normal for me. I don't know if there's anything to be done here. I just needed to tell somebody stuff. I write a lot of this stuff down, but I never tell anyone because that's just not who I am. Lastly, not to drop the bombshell, but I used to self harm. I thought I had stopped, but over the past semester, I cut 4 times. I'm ashamed about it, which is the main thing that keeps me from doing it now that I'm home, but it really helps me relieve emotional pressure. Emotional pressure is building, and I don't know how long I can sit in my house all day feeling hopeless and helpless without something snapping. sorry for rambling. Have a lovely day.

Don't get me wrong, my therapist is wonderful! All the shit in my life started in fourth grade, bullying. Getting kicked out of groups and left alone and called names like ""fat"",""ugly"", ""loser"", ""stupid"", etc. Same thing through the rest of my school experience. In 6th grade, I was raped multiple times. The guy is still out there and every time I remember I'm still at risk, I get an anxiety attack. (I have very bad anxiety). In 7th grade my teachers started bullying me too, they would tell me I'm an idiot and will never learn infront of the whole class, throw things at me, pull my hair, trip me, and once, they got together and beat me up. After the teachers showed the students that it's okay to beat me up, it became a regular thing for the kids. I got fed up, told the princepals, I even recorded a video of it on my iPod. I gave them my iPod over night for ""evidence"", next morning in the meeting with my mom, they say they never got any evidence. Never got my iPod back and was suspended for ""lying about the teachers"". My mom and dad never believed my depression or anger. They never believed that I got bullied, physically and verbally, even when I came home with black eyes and a swollen nose. They stopped talking to me for years and we still lived in the same damn house. I had to raise my little brothers because they were fucking lazy. I started cutting myself, burning, and hair pulling. Everyone said it was for attention, even though I did everything I could to hide it, deny it, and not acknowledge it. My mom started abusing me by forcing me to take off my clothes by threatnening to kill my brothers. In school, I was expelled for being caught crying in the bathroom. _PERSON_, why can't a girl be sad without getting punished? I started homeschooling. Everyday, I got over 200 texts from bullies. It was a nightmare. No one believed it was them cause they denied when approached and so the adults thought I was texting myself that stuff. My dad was always drunk and somewhere across the country. But I still loved both my parents very much for some reason. I finished my schooling at home, which destroyed any social skills I had left. My parents and relatives refuse to talk to me. I have no friends cause I can't talk to anyone except my therapist without getting anxiety. My only friend is my fucking therapist. Who I also am in love with, she doesn't know I'm a lesbian so she doesn't suspect anything. (After I got raped, I never felt secure around guys again). But she's leaving me. She hasn't answered my texts or calls for weeks, and won't say anything to me in our weekly sessions. I cry over her every night. When she does talk to me, she tells me she is tired of listening to my problems, and that she doesn't want anything to do with me. I'm not ready to let go of her. She's all I had left...Throughout the years I just explained to you, I attempted suicide 6 times. This time I hope it's for real. NO one would notice if I just disappeared, I probably wouldn't even have a funeral. I'm lonely, depressed, self harming, and I'm done. Anyway, thanks for reading my shit, I really needed to get this out, but I don't feel it changed my mind about ending my life tonight.TL;DR: Planning on hanging myself tonight cause I was bullied, raped, abused, raised my brothers cause of dead beat parents now none of my family/relatives will talk to me, I have no social life due to anxiety, and the woman of my life, (I'm a lesbian), is now leaving me in a harsh way. I give up. Guys, I need help. I've been thinking about using this site _URL_  . I am going to use the online chat line, I get way too anxious when *speaking* about my feelings when I want to commit suicide. I really enjoy the support I get from redditors on this subreddit, but I'd also like to try this hotline. I'm not feeling suicidal at the moment, I'm feeling quite well actually. But, when I do feel like ending my own life, I find it hard to bring myself to reach out for help. So I figured I'd do it now.Thank you in advance for any response. It's greatly appreciated.

149,29644,"So I get bulllied at school a lot. I always feel terrible, fat and ugly ALL THE TIME. Everyone always insults me, they think it's harmless but each  little dig about me being fat or ugly or insane is just another cut to myself inside. I don't know what to do, the teacher's will always be on their side as they have the most friends to stick up for them. I can never win. Please just tell me what to do. I'm 12, sat here with tears running down my face and punching myself in my fat stomach. I get bullied, it's getting worse. My mum says I bring it on myself, my teachers don't care, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DOI'M FAT AND UGLY AND TERRIBLE AND STUPID AND IDIOTIC AND STUPID AND FAT AND I WANT TO DIE PLEASE HELP ME.. I feel my body is trying to stop me from committing suicide. Last night I swallowed approximately 28 pills, and cut my arms up. Tuesday night, I had drunk bleach. I am planning to drink white spirit and bleach tonight and I hope to god it works. I don't know the amounts, though, to make it work. I feel fine now. The pills haven't worked. The bleach hasn't worked.I'm only 14. Help. Okay, so this week has been awful. Things happened, and I drank around a quarter of a cup of bleach on tuesday night. It did nothing, and I expressed my disappointment to my friend. (Lets call her K) K got worried and told her form tutor, then she went to my head of year. It wound up with us both sat in front of the deputy headteacher, who knows about my self harm and other issues with bullying. I end up having to lie to K's face, and the deputy headteacher, saying it was a joke, I was joking, I thought it was funny. And now they both think i'm the type of person that would make a joke like that. The deputy head is ringing my mum on monday to tell her, and my other friend (Lets call her A) found out through K about it, and is messaging my mum tomorrow to tell her. I know my mum will be so upset, and I can't do anything about it. The only way out is suicide. K &amp; A think i'm attention seeking, that I joke about stuff like that. I have nobody to confide in, no friends (not anymore). I have nothing to live for. I tried to do it last night. I wrote 4 pages of a suicide note, before taking my mum's sharpest knife and slicing up my arms. I then took her box of tablets and swallowed all 28. I put my favourite CD on and laid down in bed. Nothing happened. I can't continue. My mum says i'm a constant disappointment, she doesn't know I self harm (not anymore) . I'm lost. My schoolwork's going down the drain, I don't have the motivation to fix it anymore, my teachers hate me, I get told to kill myself on a regular basis, ''nobody's gonna care if you die'' ''Not even A!'' ''Kill yourself, just don't put my name in the suicide note'' ''Fucking lesbian cunt'' are just a few of the things I get thrown at me. I'm worthless and stupid and fucking ugly. I need to end this. I have to make sure I do it properly. I can't NOT die! I've moved on. I have a new school, I've started again. My grades are coming back up and still i'm not happy.First, there's the bullying. Always the bullying. I'm fat, yeah, I'm ugly, yeah. I get it. I keep a mirror in my bag to remind me of that fact. Some may think me vain if i'm looking at my face a lot. I'm just forcing myself to realise that nobody could ever love a girl like me. I have a crush on one of the guys that bully me. He's..ugh. He's fucking cute. He puts me down and brings me back up and I'm not quite sure how to feel. I just want him to kiss me hard and pull my hair and make me happy because I'm sure it's him that can pull this together for me. I want to self harm again. I want to take a razor blade and cut my legs, my arms, my throat until everything's just a mass of red lines. I want to disappear so I don't bother my friends. I have a friend, you know. Me and him are real close. He's wonderful. I love him. I make it seem like I have a crush on him when really? I don't. I'm just dependent on him. The crying, clinging-on don't leave me dependence. I've turned to smoking to deal with my problems. I almost got hit by a car today because I had a nicotine rush and fell into the road. My friend got me out of the way quickly. I had tears running down my face on the bus as the boy I love threw things at me and called me a fat fuck who doesn't deserve anything. I love him, Oh I love him. I don't care how much he punches me. He told me he wished I was dead. I wish I was dead. We're united in one thing. He wants me dead, I want me dead. I've turned to smoking, turned to drinking. I'm perfect with my grades, perfect with my writing. I'm a fat piece of shit that can't do anything right. Oh god. I want him to punch me. Punch me so hard it feels like a fucking kiss. I'm only 14, and someone told me they couldn't wait until I was dead today. I can't wait either. I need someone to talk to. Everyone thinks i'm a liar, i'll probably get kicked out of school. if only i could go back to december and take the right pills. Would crawling into a garbage bag and falling asleep suffocate me? I just...how do I do this. Im 15 and itsits jus not getting better!

153,30316,"I hear voices, and since I stopped my meds last Friday they're getting worse and worse and they want me to kill myself. I think to go and help them in their dimension. I'm really lonely. It's lonely hearing voices. I'm scared. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia. I don't really know if the doctor was telling me the truth, but the people I trust tell me they agree. I have an unsupportive mother, but sometimes she can be supportive. Not often. My sister is good. People would be hurt and said if I died and I really wanna stick around and watch my nephew who I love with all my heart grow up. But the voices won't quit. And I don't know how much longer I will last like this. I want to help them as they keep telling me to do, but I have to kill myself to do it. It's like a greater calling, like I'm destined to do more than live in this dimension. I have to die and travel and help people because I'm the only one that can hear them. But at the same time, I love my friends, even when they can't make time for me, and I love my family, even if they can be extremely screwed up. I just don't know what to do. I see my therapist tomorrow, and I will talk to him, but I know he is already extremely concerned about me since I stopped taking my medication and I'm afraid he'll hospitalize me, which will go over very badly with both my mother and sister. I don't know if I can handle that. A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, after having symptoms since the end of last year. I don't know what to believe anymore. Some days it's easier to believe that I'm just sick and all the beliefs I get about the world and other people, and the voices I hear, are just part of it. But most days I get sucked in, I can't stop thinking about these other worlds(dimensions) and people watching me, judging me, that people in another dimension need my help and I have to kill myself to get to them because that's what they keep telling me to do. I had to stop working, because I was hospitalized for getting really suicidal and psychotic. The hospital is where I got diagnosed. I'm off meds currently because I couldn't stand the side effects of them so i just stopped, about two and a half weeks ago or so. I just started working again, only 3 days a week at a web design company. I don't know what I want to do with the rest of my life. I feel broken. I was so sure I was going to get into making websites and stuff, and I feel like I want to know more, I know html and just looking at code makes me feel good because I love that I can understand it when I remember so clearly a time when I thought it was the most difficult thing ever and it all looked like an alien language. So I guess I'm proud of myself for learning it, even though it wasn't that hard and it's not a big thing. I just like that I can make sense of something that I couldn't before. So that's one good thing. I used to draw a lot. Now I don't. I just kinda fell out of it, from being sick. I feel stuck. I was sexually abused as a kid. And that factors into some of my ""delusions"", well, it's one of my beliefs that I don't really talk about because the one person I told assured me it wasn't real. But it haunts me. It hurts so much. I'm alone and I'm worthless and I feel like I'm never going to be as special as I felt when I was a kid getting a bunch of attention from this pedophile I though was my friend. I feel like I've lost myself this year. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what kind of future I see when sometimes it's so hard to focus and think and I feel so stupid. The best thing in my life is my nephew. He's the #1 reason I don't kill myself. Because if I can't be sure of anything, and I don't know if this is reality anymore, and everything is fucked. I know he's real, because I've watched him grow up, and he's almost a kid, and it's amazing seeing him learn and change and I'm scared to go and lose seeing more of that. But at the same time I'm through with being hurt and sad and my brain not working, I'm through with questioning every gorram thing and every person that looks at me. it's exhausting. It's so lonely to hear voices telling me that they need my help and I have to kill myself and nobody seems to care or understand it. Anyone have any idea what I'm supposed to do next? It's either kill myself or find something meaningful to do for myself and I'm lost about it. It doesn't seem like there's anything I can do to escape this. Schizophrenia is sort of a lifelong thing. There's no escaping. I'm schizophrenic. Gonna go off meds soon. I hate them. They're wrong. I was just molested on the bus(reported it). Felt like my childhood sexual abuse. I'm just done. My brain isn't working anymore. Starting to see things in addition to hearing voices. Fuck it. It's important that I die. Everyone will be better off without me. This time next week I'll know whether or not I got the housing that I was waiting for to be in a sober living home so I can finally get out of my mom's house. If I don't get it I'm done. I can't be here anymore.This housing is the only hope I have for a better future. I'm so tired of not knowing what is real. I'm 22 and a diagnosed schizophrenic. I miss my voices. The meds made them go away. I don't even know what they mean anymore. Were they just tricking me? I wanna scream so much. I hate myself. The meds made me fat and ugly and now my family hates me. The want me to die. They don't want an ugly daughter.I feel so alone. I have blades. And alcohol. I could just get drunk, cut away the suffering and get to be free. I'm schizophrenic. And tired. My meds make me sick to my stomach and tired but they're the only ones that work. I'm torn between even wanting them to work and wanting them to fail.I still want to hear voices. They have important messages for me that no one believes in. But I do. And I need to her them. Last they told me was to kill myself, that my meds were poison and that I am their savior.I have to kill myself soon. Dunno how soon. But I have to do it. I want to cut so badly. Maybe I will. But I don't want to risk going to a mental hospital before I commit suicide.So goodbye, 'verse. Soon I'll be gone. I'm thinking by the end of the month. Fraking help me. My family, my beloved family who are just if not even more screwed up are leaving me. My sister is taking my nephew away from me. Moving to a new state for financial reasons. He is my absolute world. I've watched him grow, and think, and create adorable stories that could make anyone laugh. I've watched him become more and more human each day and I've had him call me his best friend and call me lego face on halloween when I dressed up as pixels and he means the 'verse to me. The whole gorram 'verse. He keeps me still when I want to grab a blade or a bottle of pills and do very stupid things to myself. He keeps me thinking about the benefits of tomorrow instead of the pain.But some days I'm so broken he can't fix me. Me. His aunt. I have schizophrenia. And some days I'm all too aware of it, and some days, I'm gone, some days I can't be bothered to use logic and admit to reality. Some days I spend in my head, talking to other dimensional victims of an interdimentional God that I hear in my head. That I know quite personally at this point. I've thought about it enough.He won't remember me. He's only 3. He won't remember. I won't be too important in his life if I go now. I don't want to leave him. I want to watch him grow up into a successful little human and earn all his happiness. I want to watch him be the good person I know he will be because his heart is so sweet. But I don't get that. Nope. I don't deserve that. I have other goals. Other missions. Fraking delusions. I don't know that they are.My name is Cristine, I'm 22 years old. And I'm can communicate with other dimensions. I can hear them, and sometimes see them, and they're begging me for help, they're calling me their savior. ""Your God, he seeks you"" The demon is a God and he is waiting for me on the other side. Waiting to fight for the people he's abusing. I'm all too aware I'm schizophrenic. But this isn't apart of it. This is real. This has to be real. I have to kill myself to save them. I have to kill myself to go their dimension and kill their demon, their God. He's looking for me. I miss my nephew already. He means so much to me but I have to abandon him for the countless lives I have to save in the other dimension. This isn't easy for me. This is very horribly painful.I only hope he doesn't remember me. I'm losing. Whatever the universe is doing to me. I'm losing. What's keeping me going now is sitting at home watching scifi shows and reading comics. Trying to keep calm about my own death. I'm gonna do it in one month. I'm giving myself that much time to get things in order, to have someone convince me the people I HEAR and the people I FEEL suffering are just my brain miscommunications. Oh frak I want to cut. I want to bleed. They told me to, anyways. ""Sacrifice your blood"". I'm so far. So lost in the woods. Someone show me a clear path. Did any of that even make sense? I feel so messed up right now. It could just look like nonsense. Please help me. I'm only asking here, on reddit, because I trust reddit's help. I've gotten good help from here in the past. Good people.Help. I'm 22. I'm a schizophrenic. I firmly believe in other dimensions. I believe that I can communicate with one. I can hear and rarely see people and creatures from the other dimension. The voices I hear tell me that I have to kill myself in order to travel to the other dimension and kill a mad God that is hurting everyone there. The mad God is also a man from this dimension that abused me as a child and died here and was transported there. I don't know why. But that's what it is. I'm on meds. I'm well aware that my story above sounds pretty fraked up and crazy. I'm aware it sounds delusional and I'm aware that I'm schizophrenic. But fraking frak. The delusional thinking is so seductive. It grabs hold of me and I can't get it out of my head. I keep thinking that I have to go off my meds, I have to hear voices again, I'm their savior. I have to save them. To save them means to end my life. And now I'm seriously considering it. Just like I've done before, except before I determined that it was all a bad idea, that I was simply sick, that the world didn't have that much planned for me. I wasn't really that important. Not the savior of a whole dimension of people suffering and the hands of a pedophile.And now, maybe I am. Maybe it's sick to say. It's just schizophrenia. It's just this disease I have leading me the wrong way in the 'verse. Or maybe I'm really that important. And I need to end my life to save billions. I can get close to him. I'm already close to him. I don't know what to do. I want to go off meds, hear voices clearer, listen to what they say and kill myself.. that's my plan. I don't know what to do. I'm schizophrenic. I miss the voices. I'm all alone now. I have to save them, have to kill myself. I think I'm going to do it. I should be getting my refill of Ativan today or tomorrow and with the pills I still have left I think I can leave this dimension and go to the next to save my people. I'm done. I'm absolutely done. No one believes me. No one in real life really gets the struggle. I can't. My therapist says I have ""constant conflicts with reality"" due to my schizophrenia.I can't do this anymore. I have to SAVE a world in another dimension, from a demon. That's as simply as i can put it. That's the gorram truth and no one sees it. They have to open their eyes.When my meds get here I'm off. Gonna take a ton of Ativan(I get the 2mg pills instead of 1), with a ton of alcohol and let myself go into the other dimension. It's my responsibility. I need help. Voices. I'm schizophrenic. Voices. ""You're crazy"" ""Kill yourself"" ""Your brain is broken"" ""You're a burden"" ""wake up, you're in hell"" ""free me"" ""Kill yourself"" I'm better than I was. I admit, I have schizophrenia. There's no doubt anymore. Multiple diagnoses and all. I'm sick.""Can you hear me?"" ""Help us"" I just need to talk. To cry. I need help. It's too much to handle. I'm trying to be a person but all I'll ever be is a mentally ill burden on my family. Might as well settle in a board and care now since I'll probably be in one for life. Never see the world. Never love anyone. Just be alone in my head with these voices. I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia,, and lately it has been unbearable. Every city, every house, every room. The voices never stop. It's my job to listen to them because I'm their God. They tell me to kill myself many many time throughout the day, see they need me to die here by suicide so I can go to their dimension and get my God-like abilities back, and defeat a demon that is tormenting them. It's much more intense lately. Urgent. I have to do it *today*. I'm going to find a high parking structure and jump off. I have to do it. But I'm scared.. but I'm still gonna do it. Nothing else matters now, I just have to save them. I live in a Sober Living for my Schizophrenia.. I've been off meds for over a week now and I'm hearing voices. Telling me the truth that the house manager and owner want me to kill myself. They're practically giving me the blade. I know that's what they're thinking, pushing the thoughts on me. Showing their true colors. They're not on my side. I want to cut so bad. I miss it. I *need* it. I talked and talked and talked to the voices for hours yesterday. Just trying to get them to seem fake, but they're not. They're real voices. And I *do* have to kill myself. My family hates me, too. Everyone does. When they're outside smoking they're talking about how much they hate me and want me to kill myself or at least try so I get kicked out of the house, move to my mom's and kill myself from the stress of that. My coworker called me the other day because I seemed ""sad"" at work and he wanted to make sure I was ok. But it wasn't just him. He and a female coworker of mine were talking about me about how I seemed ""sad"". They don't want to make sure I'm ok. I'm sure my boss has told them about my previous hospitalizations, about how I've missed so much work due to being in a mental hospital. I'm sure they know, waiting for me to break. Fuck fuck fuck. Fucking Fuck I hate them all back and I'll SHOW them. I show 'em. I have to do it. Everyone NEEDS me to. It's too late to be ""better"". Can't talk to my roommates, can't talk to anybody. They get concerned and it scares me to be scaring them. Voices are back. I want to cut. Really deeply. Bleed everywhere and die. I'm schizophrenic but I don't know if I can believe that anymore. I'm tapping into another dimension.I'm fat. I am so fucking fat and ugly. Not fit to be a God. I get medication tomorrow, a shot. Then this all goes away but is it even right?? I hate this. I just want to kill myself. Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. I’m just walking through the part. Everyday is the same. I work, I function like I'm a girl, and I go home and fall apart because I don't have enough distractions.The voices say none of it is real. None of it. That I need to ""wake up"" because maybe I'm dreamin'. Maybe we all are. And I **created** another dimension as a kid. I made myself the God of it, and it's very real. And I've never belonged and now it's time for me to kill myself to go there and be a God and save everyone from demons. Things from hell.I think I have to do it this time. I take medication that makes everything blurrier and melts who I am away. I'm not a person anymore, I can't stand it. I know the truth and I have to kill myself. I'm not a person. This body, this place, means nothing. Yes, I wish I wasn't true. I have people I care for, places I love to go. But they don't mean what you think! None of it means a damn thing.They're all lying about the Schizophrenia, my diagnosis. The medication numbs my ability to hear the voices but I know they're there. Screaming for me to save them.I have to do it, it's so much bigger than me. They're people, *suffering* people. I have to be their God. I have to. I'm sorry. I have to do it. The voices are gone and it's not ok. It's WRONG. I have to kill myself. I have to save them. Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. It's never gonna be ok. I'm meant for something more, and my God is seeking me and it's wrong. It's all fucking wrong. I have to go to HELL, actual HELL in another dimension to save them and I HAVE TO SAVE THEM.I don't know what's right anymore. Is anything? I have to. No one can be trusted. They're reading this now, as I type, watching me with invisibility cloaks. All around me. INTANGIBLE. SURROUNDED.I fucking hate this. I hate it. Sick of medication. Sick of doctor's appointments and therapy and LIES. They know the truth and they are PRETENDING. Making me believe my family is real when the love is a lie. I hate them. He isn't real. He isn't real. The voices are real and I'm going to do it SOON. I GOTTA.Maybe today's the day. Gonna go save the world. Go to another dimension. I have to wake up. There's so much empty *space*. it's getting bad again. Not the delusions, not the voices, not the Schizophrenia. Though I hear them screaming every night. I can handle that.I am so distant. So far from ok. I remember him, sitting on his lap, so small. So young. And he would touch me. Every time I saw him, he would. For years and years. And I was just a kid... I just wanted to be a kid.And he took that away from me. From so many. I need to disappear. I can't cope. I can't. He took my childhood, my adolescence. And now he's got me still, at 23. He's got me. He's dead and he has this grip that will never loosen. He's dead and he *got away*.. he's free. I'm stuck here, holding the pressure of the *Evil*. There is no justice. No peace. No freedom. And there is no safety. There's so much empty space. Empty space in my memories, what did he *do* to me?!I'm so alone. I'm alone. I'm absolutely fucking alone. I need to just die. I'm small and worthless and I can't think straight. I can't do this. I can't be his victim. I can't be left to cope with the nightmare that he created for me. I have to wake up. I just want to end it.. be safe. Be more.The demons are creeping up on me again. Seeing things out the corner of my eye. Whispers and screaming, the kind of screaming that sounds like the person is so terrified. It doesn't go away. Then there are the screams in my heart. The unsteady, rage-filled heart that is an object to a pedophile. Nothing here is real. Is it? I can't tell. I can't know for sure. I love my family. Some of 'em. It's all I've got. These people that will never understand me. They're all I've got.But I doubt that they're real, right? Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. Please forgive me. I'm begging. Let go of my death as it doesn't mean what you think.I stand alone in this. The blood dripping down my arms in memories is the only peace I can get, and I can't even do it anymore.I have no savior, I am no savior.","I keep going back and forth on it, I feel like I could do it very soon I feel like I don't have a future anymore If I don't get housing next week I'm offing myself.

154,30432,"I suffer from severe depression, as most likely a lot of people here do. Im not here for help or to whine, just to rant a bit and maybe talk to some fellow crazies. Ive had depression and anxiety issues since I was young. My first attempted suicide I was only seven years old. I watched my dad abuse our dogs, abuse me, and abuse alcohol on a regular basis. My mom kept herself locked in her room, leaving me and my sisters alone every day. Ever since ive been at war with my own mind. As I grew older everything got worse and worse. I started using drugs, became a sex addict, and pushed away everyone who tried helping. The only person I trusted was Christina. This girl was my world. We dated all throughout highschool and a while after. When she got pregnant I joined the army as a way to support them. Even though I had what seemed to be a great life, I couldnt shake the suicidal thoughts. Things went south. One night she had to talk me off a roof, and it was more than she could handle. She left me and took my son. I was devastated. For months I wouldnt talk to anybody or leave the house. Eventually I went broke and became homeless. Jumping around from place to place, the drug use got worse. After a few years, I fell back in love. I was depressed, but so was she. We would lock ourselves in a basement smoking pot and sniffing dope. Over time we both cleaned up. Ive been working part time and trying to keep myself clean. Recently, she left me as well, letting me know explicitly that she only wants drugs and sex from random guys. I was crushed. Now im at an old friends, wasting away day after day. I battle suicidal thoughts constantly, never trusting myself around ropes or sharp objects. Ive tried to control myself, but I find myself lashing out, slicing my chest and scalp, stabbing my legs and forearms. I do not wish to do this, something simply takes hold of me and forces my hand. At those moments, I dont care if I live or die, and that scares me. The amount of blood ive seen pour out of me before passing out has made me certain would never wake, yet here we are today. Im not a violent person towards anyone but myself, even blaming myself for other people wronging me. I can never trust myself, as im constantly plagued by these dark thoughts. I know one day my life will end by way of my own hand, and ive accepted that. Now I just battle myself every day, seeing how long I can last. Im simply waiting for that one day it will all end.TLDR I'm my own worst enemy, and every day is a fight.",Constantly at war with myself,suffer severe depression lot people whine rant bit talk fellow crazies ve depression anxiety issues young attempted suicide years watched dad abuse dogs abuse abuse alcohol regular basis mom locked room leaving sisters day ve war mind grew older worse worse started drugs sex addict pushed helping person trusted christina girl world dated highschool pregnant joined army support great life nt shake suicidal thoughts things south night talk roof handle left son devastated months nt talk leave house eventually broke homeless jumping place place drug worse years fell back love depressed lock basement smoking pot sniffing dope time cleaned ve working part time clean recently left letting explicitly drugs sex random guys crushed friends wasting day day battle suicidal thoughts constantly trusting ropes sharp objects ve control find lashing slicing chest scalp stabbing legs forearms simply takes hold forces hand moments nt care live die scares amount blood ve pour passing made wake today violent person blaming people wronging trust constantly plagued dark thoughts day life end hand ve accepted battle day long simply waiting day end tldr worst enemy day fight,constantly war,5.0,485.0,0.5625,1.0,3.367295829986474,1.2728285889840787,1.0,182
155,30566,"This life has many ideas that can help the world.But what's the point of life if the world, including me, can't help myself?All I want is love, but after a time I realized my family isn't a lovely one, it was just a family with all members loving each other, but our mean was hatred to non-christian society. A desire to get away from humans that dare act natural in specific ways.I know how to be alone quite well. I'm quite good at it. Of course, there is my brother, who provides much comfort and plenty of lighthearted jokes that are fun to be a part of. But everyone in my family, I can feel them all expecting me to change back to who I was when I was younger.I smoke pot and dropped out because I felt like school was a waste of time. To you, I'm your typical drop out nut job. I am a nut job, because I know what people mean when they say that. They mean I do the things that they would be uncomfortable doing themself, I say GReAT good for you want a fucking trophy! I love this planet so much and life an biology all can get me so excited. Not to mention the other sciences, which are so captivating to the brain I was born with. I am so passionate about our Universe, I am even quite grippy on my own life. But the thing is, I just don't see the horizon anymore. I think becoming someone acceptable to society is an extremely stupid cause, one of ignorance and desire. Something that bothers me is that people do not see that as a sensible perspective of our society. I don't blame people for ignoring great facts and conforming to whatever gets them at least the minimal amount of dopamine their brain wants. To blame people is pointless, I hate blaming, my father always loved to analyze who is to blame for every fault, Eventually I saw it differently that the mistakes are what makes us, literally. I look around and I don't see a perfect society, and that's fine everyone does that and they think about it every long afternoon and get on with their busy lives. Me? I had a lot more time to think. The truth is, if society was set up differently, we would each and all have found our best friends. How? Well, first it would require a society that cares about the human biology and the first inventions: Nature. Our society, here in America at least, is concerned with profits. The feeling I get about America's history is that the intention of this design was so that people can have a life to their own, versus how it was in England where everything for a single person was not immune from the monarchy's every desire.My life is sad, because I am sad. I am less sad when I remember suicide. I have no close friend for many miles. But I have no one that is like me, no one that got as excited as purely for simply being alive. Besides, if I go to pass, it will be a small loss for you all, I promise. If you don't believe me, [well](_URL_ yeah. I know that value is an imagined thing and I can assign value to my life, and I in fact value my life extremely. This is not a matter of logic, it is a matter of feeling. You know how you felt like marrying that one person? And so you did? That's the same with people who commit suicide. They feel like dying over and over again and every time it interacts with their logic thus compounds more and more as a real possibility. I have reached a point I've reached many times where it seems like a good idea to commit suicide. The reason I may want to really do it is because I always reach a state where I feel alienated from the people I hold tender. One thing I noticed is I have become narcissistic, and by a very traditional sense; I barely post on social media websites. I actually just enjoy my own company, and I used to think when I was young and children would call me weird, and now today my brother who visits from out of state he calls me weird. I don't mind being called weird, except for when it is said in these instances. The weird that people say just so they can get away from absorbing you. Their mind says ""delete that act because it's useless"". To me, being weird is life. Doing things for the sake of doing them instead of for a purpose is what I want to do with my life. Truly, it's what everyone wants to do! I know I can escape my suicidal thoughts, but, is it worth it?Let me add, I know how getting into a routine of any sort will help me to distract myself from suicide. I do not want a distraction, I want to fix my problems at the root and to me what fixing my problems at the root means learning how to survive in nature and leaving for any edge into a forest for good. I would actually love to do that, but I would far much prefer to live anywhere where there are people willing to meet disagreement with acceptance. I want to meet inquisitive people, they are quite rare aren't they? Many people think they are great thinkers but really they are just good at talking.If you want to send me videos, articles, book titles whatever, that would be fine. Thank you for reading this internet buddy.Just read my post before posting, and here's a the main reason: Humans crave ludicrously to be part of a community. Thankfully, we are all born into a community. However, at some point in our life we realize we have different core beliefs than the community does, so we feel so alienated that we would hope for a while, and eventually, like a sun setting, we lose hope, we didn't run fast enough, whatever the cause, and we just realize that when we are so alone in our core beliefs that the only one that will truly feel the pain of your loss is no one. The feeling of alienation is only bad when people do it with a heart of hatred, to alienate someone with love is to naturally alienate them and then fight the alienating response your having and to be kind to them. I haven't felt love in a long time, just dopamine from people telling me that they do.",It seems really logical for me to commit suicide.,life ideas world point life world including love time realized family lovely family members loving hatred christian society desire humans dare act natural specific ways good brother comfort plenty lighthearted jokes fun part family feel expecting change back younger smoke pot dropped felt school waste time typical drop nut job nut job people things uncomfortable themself great good fucking trophy love planet life biology excited mention sciences captivating brain born passionate universe grippy life thing horizon anymore acceptable society extremely stupid ignorance desire bothers people perspective society blame people ignoring great facts conforming minimal amount dopamine brain blame people pointless hate blaming father loved analyze blame fault eventually differently mistakes makes literally perfect society fine long afternoon busy lives lot time truth society set differently found friends require society cares human biology inventions nature society america concerned profits feeling america history intention design people life versus england single person immune monarchy desire life sad sad sad remember suicide close friend miles excited purely simply alive pass small loss promise url yeah imagined thing assign life fact life extremely matter logic matter feeling felt marrying person people commit suicide feel dying time interacts logic compounds real possibility reached point reached times good idea commit suicide reason reach state feel alienated people hold tender thing noticed narcissistic traditional sense barely post social media websites enjoy company young children call weird today brother visits state calls weird mind called weird instances weird people absorbing mind delete act useless weird life things sake purpose life escape suicidal thoughts worth add routine sort distract suicide distraction fix problems root fixing problems root means learning survive nature leaving edge forest good love prefer live people meet disagreement acceptance meet inquisitive people rare people great thinkers good talking send videos articles book titles fine reading internet buddy read post posting main reason humans crave ludicrously part community thankfully born community point life realize core beliefs community feel alienated hope eventually sun setting lose hope run fast realize core beliefs feel pain loss feeling alienation bad people heart hatred alienate love naturally alienate fight alienating response kind felt love long time dopamine people telling,logical commit suicide,9.0,1119.0,0.1761001275510204,0.0,3.828641396489095,1.237922333087208,1.0,356

My parents don't fight much or abuse me, I have had a boyfriend for six months, I live in a nice house, and I can afford some of the things I want (but don't necessarily need), and I have great friends. However, I feel completely dead to the world. I feel like that I have no connections with people, especially my friends and parents (my boyfriend is the closest one I have, but even to him, I feel disconnected sometimes). I feel that I have no meaning to be in this world. Everyone else seems to have their priorities straight, but I can't seem to find a meaning for me to be here. Also, I feel that I can never do anything right. I have noticed that this could stem from my family. At home, when I do chores and such, I get yelled at because it's not good enough (Mom has OCD). I have told my parents 3 times in the past 4 months that I think I'm depressed and that I have been contemplating suicide, but they never do anything about it. I have talked to friends and a couple of adults, and they told me to keep telling my parents. I don't know where to turn or what to do.Edit: Thanks for the support, guys. I wrote this at 6 in the morning, so I missed a few minor details. For instance, depression runs in my family. Both my grandmother and older brother have been diagnosed with severe cases. Why my parents don't believe/listen to me, hell if I know. Also, I was going to mention that I have given up on religion (live in the Bible Belt; parents are strict Christians), and for a while I thought that was the source of my emptiness, but it's not. Also, I saw a [movie](_URL_ that was about a kid who turned himself in for depression/suicidal thoughts. After watching the movie with my brother, I told him that it was exactly how I felt. (Great movie, by the way.) It seems, though, that some people are just saying to think positively.. It's really, really difficult for me, and I don't know why. I've tried in the past, though. I had a friend who wanted to help and did her own research, and tried to give me advice. One was to write down three good things that happened today, and the other was to try to revert bad thoughts into good by coming up with silly mental images related to the negative thought. The silly mental image was supposed to be silly enough to make me laugh on the inside and cause a small bit of dopamine to be released, causing the bad thought to be silly and meaningless, while the good thought remained to be the more important one. These two things worked effectively, but only for just a couple of days, and then it wore off.

In uncontrolable fetishes, in murder fantasy. I broke into a friends moms house and stole her shoes and jewelry. Today I wanted to snatch someones purse for money, so I could get drugs to take me away from this world. I will probably still do it. And some how I dont feel bad doing any of it. Ive stolen from friends and family. Im a kleptomaniac and I enjoy it. Why does anyone give a shit about me? If they even really do. Why? Im a petty con man and thief. I wasnt raised in poverty. My family has wealth, yet I've the gall to squander my oppurtunities and shit on my future? I dont deserve to even be miserable and yet I am. Every hour just compounding pain. Ive been in pysch wards twice now. The first one during a horribly abusive ""friendship"". I stayed 4 days. 4 days of torture. No privacy, constant screaming from the other in patients. They put me on Risperdal, I think that shit permanently fucked my brain. Ruined my fucking mine. For what, for a company to make a buck? Is that all I am, a fucking geaunie pig? A fucking failed experiment? Well I certainly failed. Ive dropped out of college 4 fucking times. I have so many failed classes. The only jobs Ive ever had was shitty fast food or cleaning. I used to work at _PERSON_. When I had weed things could be okay. When I didnt every moment spent alone led to mental breakdown. I would regularly cry during delivery runs, or in the freezer when I worked inside. I quite without notice, twice. Ive quit all my jobs without notice. What did it matter anyways? They were shit jobs for minimum wage.I fucking hate being alive. I cant be happy anymore. The only time Im ever happy is if I can get high with weed. Look down me for it. Call me a drug addict, call me a junkie this world will. But I dont know a single fucking soul that doesnt down something to make it through the day. If I could just live in the woods and grow pot and food and smoke all day I fucking would. But I cant, because if I did then some fuckers would come up, burn it to the ground then point guns at me and shove me into a cage until I rotted and died. And society would be okay with it, many would even applaud it. A joke. ""Do what whatever makes you happy!"" Is a fucking joke. Anyone who says it is a goddamn stand up comedian. Okay. Sure. Fine. Want to know what would make me happy? Well I already told you. Id live in nature in the forest and Id grow a field of pot and harvest it. But I cant, so I cant be happy. Now go ahead and tell me Im wrong. Tell me that wouldnt make me happy and Im just ever so obviously confused. No no, youre right and Im wrong, because you said so. If you wanna be happy just get on your knees and beg the demon in the sky to grant you entrance to hia kingdom. Then slave away at a shit job you dont like to earn money for people you dont like to provide service you hate to customers you hate. Do it shit eater, go get your shit eating job and put on your shit eating grin so you can make it another day to be promoted to shit eater leader.I live in a world where our elected leaders control a large group of violent people that will kill anyone on command.I live in a world where psychotropic pills are shoved down the throats of the mentally ill and weak to sedate them and generate profit with little to no understanding of how they work.I live in a world where children are slain and raped and beaten by their own parents.A world where in my home country oppposers to the gangs and police and politicians, who are one in the same are killed.People believe in demons and gods based on fairy tales in a book. But okay sure. Im the monster, obviously. I really am because Ive never done _PERSON_ shit about it but complain. Never done _PERSON_ shit to help anyone else because Im a hipocritical stuck up close minded shit eating faggot fat worthless unfriendly slobbish beast of the wild that calls itself human.And now the good shit. This world is trash and so am _PERSON_ on a killing spree would be fun, in theory. But no, fuck that. Fuck that mass murder spree bullshit. Thatshit makes the world into the place driving me to this in the first place. So _PERSON_ probably go on a stealing spree. Buy a shit load of weed, smoke myself silly and then in a moment where I feel good _PERSON_ shoot myself. Or maybe down pills and booze. Whichever is more appealing. Im not long for this world. But dont miss me, Im not worth missing. Dont mourne me, my life was garbage anyways. If you do, then go take something you dont like and then throw it in the bin. Then cry for days over it. Become depressed over it, maybe even suicidal yourself. Then hold a funeral service. But you wouldnt because thats stupid. Because putting that much emotional invesment over a piece of trash in the bin is fucking retarded. So what makes me any different? If I werent so goddamn egotistical and self centered I probably wouldve already died already. I have to die some day anyways. Might as well deprive nature the sick pleasure of picking my demise for me and instead taking it for myself.Im sorry to my brother. Although you can be angry crude and mean, you genuinely cared. You really fucking did. You are honestly one in a billion, a good person. Im sorry I dont love you more to stop myself from causing you pain. But I love you.Im sorry to my past self. It didnt get better, I lied to you. It only got worse and I lied to your face, torturing you for the amusment of others.Im sorry to anyone this hurts. But theres nothing I can do about it. I will die anyways. Im not going through pain to appease others anymore, I just cant handle it, Im just not strong enough. Im just going to have one last toke and then its goodbye.

178,33604,"[EDIT] Goodbye.I'm not intending this to sound like a rant, so I apologize if it comes off that way. I'm just a long winded person.I was born on tour with the Grateful Dead at the Forum in L.A., needless to say my parents were hippies. They moved up to Canada before I was a year old, but my Dad constantly beat my Mom so they divorced when I was 4. The only time I saw him after that was at my cousins funeral when I was 17. I held my tongue out of respect for my cousin who passed away.When I was 12 my Mom, sister, and I moved down to San Diego, California. I went from a very happy community, where I had good friends, to a place where I knew nothing about. Every day was hell as I would constantly get beat on (my middle school has a lot of ""cholo"" kids, as did my high schools). So I started taking self defense to protect my self at school. Karate became my life, as I was spending almost every day at the _PERSON_, eventually becoming the Sempai (Highest _PERSON_) of the class.After I finished Middle school, I was on the bottom of the totem pole, but that quickly changed as my classmates learned I could now fight back.Then, one day as I was walking home I dropped by my old middle school to say hi to my friends that were in the grade below me. Where one of the bullies that had once picked on me was still attending, as he had been held back a year. He, unaware to my new ability to fight, attacked me barehanded. While he managed to break my glasses, he only succeeded in enraging me. I lost my temper and started beating him as hard as I could. In the chaos, he pulled out a knife, which I had been taught to defend myself against. I reversed the blade on him, planting it into his own stomach. This secured my arrest, and expulsion from the San Diego school district.I was promptly sent to _PERSON_, which is where I spent 6 months of not knowing what became of the boy I fought and stabbed. Eventually not caring. The only time I cried is when I found out my dog, Cisco, had been put to sleep while I was locked up. It was really after this that I started to notice an absence of emotions.After spending Christmas, and my 15th birthday in Juvy, I was released into House Arrest for another 6 months. The only communication I was allowed was online, which was how I stayed in contact with my friends in Canada, as I didn't have good enough friends to talk to me after that incident in San Diego. However, I was allowed 1 on 1 time at the _PERSON_ with my Sensei. I was spending around 12 hours a day training.By the time I was off house arrest, I had caught up to my schooling through JCCS. Being expelled from my high school left me with little option of where to attend. So I entered the Charter School program. Which allowed me to continue spending most of my time training, as I was finishing semesters in a matter of days, and only turning in the work once every 2 weeks. This lasted for around a year.When I was 16 I wanted to start attending a normal school again and try to still manage some sort of a normal adolescence. I had gotten back into my High School that I was originally attending. Unfortunately, 2 months after the school year began, my Mom had a disagreement with the principal, which lead to me immediate expulsion. Then after a long bout of trial and error with different schools in the area, all of which I was expelled for fighting (in self defense). I was allowed into La Jolla High School. Which is a VERY respected high school. On the only condition that if I was not allowed to fight. In the situation of a fight, I was to just get hit and leave it at that. And that was fine by me, for the chance to graduate normally. Actually walk and get my high school diploma.Since La Jolla High was operating on a classic schedule, and my old school was on a 4 block schedule, I was staying after school for an ""8th period"" where I was in the office answering phones for an extracurricular. At 3:30pm I got out, went to a vending machine, just for a snack as I was VERY hungry. Not even 2 minutes after I sat down for my gummi worms, yet another bully came up to me for the sole purpose of torment. He took my food, and when I asked for it back, he punched me in the stomach. It barely hurt, so I knew taking a beating was entirely possible. I made it through the ordeal with my favorite Rufio shirt torn into an unwearable state. a bloody lip, and some bruises on my abdomen. Nothing bad at all. And that didn't even slow them down what-so-ever in my expulsion. Regardless of the ""don't throw a punch"" promise that I held up to. They still kicked me out.In the very same week, my Sensei, whom I thought to be dying (shes 70+) from the manner in which she was teaching me, told me she was moving to a different state. She told me this while I was a low brown belt, and for the next year I trained every day, so when she moved to train with the head of my style (Hanshi, aka Teacher of Teachers) I followed her and skipped my middle brown belt, and high brown belt, to achieve _PERSON_, or First Black Belt. I am very proud of this, but there isn't much a black belt from a traditional style can do with out their Sensei. So with no where to go from there, I joined the Military.I origionally wanted to become an EOD, but due to a training accident in bootcamp, that quickly became more fantasy. What I thought was a sprain, turned out to be a rare, untreated form of _PERSON_. Which ruined blood flow to my talus navicular causing it to collapse. I thought it was just a sprain so I kept it to myself, not wanting to stay in boot camp any longer than I had to. So I switched rates to Fire Control (The guys that shoot the cannons on a ship).This rate turned out to have a 2 year contract extension, which I signed in a stack of papers I was told to sign.And that 2 years was spent at Great Lakes, _PERSON_. _PERSON_. This base had one of the highest suicide rates out of any base in the military. I believe there were 3-6 in the 2 years I spent there, accounting for roughly 10% of all suicides in the navy per year. Needless to say, I was unhappy.I was constantly in trouble for the sole reason of my depression. To the point where I would sleep in a comatose state, and they would be unable to wake me with the assistance of a Bullhorn.When the truth of my injury came to light, the base doctors put it down as a ""prior injury"" due to the wear on the bones from my martial arts training. When taken I was taken to an orthopedic surgeon he said my foot would be able to be fixed with surgery, and my Tricare would cover it. When it came time for my insurace company to say they would foot the bill, they stepped up to the plate and said they would pay in full. All I needed was approval for the convalescent leave. Which the base denied on the ground that they were removing me from service. Which I had heard no news of until it came time to fix my foot. They kicked me out with half months pay x4 which had to come out of my TSP.And now I've been out for a year. In which I helped my family open a medicinal marijuana dispensary, that I may or may not work at. I say that because every day I live in fear of getting fired. Lately it's been so bad that I may not even be able to make rent this month. As every day I show up for work, I get yelled at for something irrelevent to work. The reason I'm currently fired is because I lost a contact lens. The time before that was because I didn't eat breakfast.I'm running out of ability to tolerate the world. If anyone can bring the slightest ammount of happiness to me, it would be much appreciated. But as it stands, I'm ready to kill myself.",I don't think I can take anymore.

182,33936,"Not intentionally, and it's probably not even a cry. I tend to be extremely silent in the case of my emotions. It'd be nice to have someone to talk to about them, but it has been beaten into me since I was young that I don't have significant problems, that they are my own, and I should not bother people with them because they do not matter, essentially. I wish that I could break this mentality, but it's extremely difficult, and I hate putting stress on others, I hate being a burden, and I would rather help everyone else be happy than to work on myself being happy. Needless to say things are rather...rough (put very loosely). My friends (what little ones I do have) hardly notice when anything is wrong, then when they do I feel guilty that they did. I feel like I wasted their time when they come to me because I know I'm going to lie to them and tell them I'm fine, and that I don't need any help. I'm going to go home that night, and cry because I'm so fed up with everything, which usually leads to the ritual of self-hate and inevitably picking up the blade. I wish I could stop, I really do. I hate this, almost as much as I hate myself for everything I do. I started therapy, and it's nerve wracking. Between the anxiety and the (still very real) overbearing feeling of guilt and mistrust, I don't know how well this is going to help. I made a new friend, and already I feel like I'm doing is annoying and boring him. I really do want friends, I just don't know how to make them properly? I don't know. I don't know where to start and things are just terrible. Things are a little hectic in my life right now. I'm seeing a therapist who is doing pro-bono work for me, and it's helping but only to a certain degree. I keep a lot from my friends and family, and it's gotten to the point where the only things that help are some of the worse. Worse yet, one of my closest friends has inexplicably ceased contact with me. It's only made things that much more difficult to handle because I've tried what I've been thinking is my best to stay friends. We had a really great weekend, and then nothing. No explanation, either. It just solidifies the thought in my head that people don't actually care about anyone beyond themselves, and that most people are lying through their teeth when they say they care. I don't understand how I can get this feeling to stop. I don't even feel like I exist. I sit in my room every single night and cry and I don't really know the reason why anymore. The feeling of helplessness is so overwhelming, and I only feel even more worthless when I reach out like this. There's a little piece of me that breaks even more when I can't be everyone's rock anymore. I need someone, anyone really. My best friend didn't care, my family doesn't.

186,34169,"Hey reddit. I'm a female Canadian who is about a month away from turning 20. I currently have not finished high school and am failing miserably at getting my last 2 credits. I can't even step into a class room because of the fear of people judging me. I suffer from anxiety disorders and depression. The only person who knows about the problems I'm having at school is my boyfriend. We've been dating for a year. Well last night we kind of had a bit of an argument. I say kind of because it was more him getting annoyed and telling me I'm not trying enough and me just agreeing with him to make it go away. I'm probably not trying enough and I could probably do better. I should have my high school it's not that hard of a goal. I mean, I should be in some form of post secondary school by now (even though I have no way in hell to afford it).Last night it got to the point where I was counting out how many pills I have and whether or not it would likely kill me to take all of them. It likely wouldn't but considering my grandfather doesn't notice if I leave the house or not, I wouldn't get medical help until thursday because that's when my mom visits.I think the main reasons I haven't done anything is because of my mom, my boyfriend, and my oldest niece who considers me her best friend. I think she could have it explained to her if I did go through with suicide (she's gifted) but I don't want her to have to understand this concept...I don't want to leave her.But I'm screwing up my life. I don't want to keep going this way. I've tried going to a hospital before for suicidal thoughts but I was told that ""I'm not the type"" and I should sleep off the feelings. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to give up so badly but I don't how to make it any easier for them. I mean, mom's busy worrying abiut grandpa's health and I don't want to burden her. I could get into a fight with my boyfriend and breakup with him...That could make it easier on him but that still leaves two people...I don't know how to get help or what to do anymore...I'm still thinking about it but I still have a few things left to do. I'm buying my boyfriend's birthday present next weekend and the weekend after I'm babysitting that niece I mentioned earlier. After that...I don't know what there is to cling onto. I've been using family events for the past month just to get through each week. Sorry I just need to get this off my chest. Sorry for posting. Just need to unload on a place where nobody knows me.I know I sound crazy but hear me out. I'm a trans guy who will be 22 this may. I'm depressed, have a shit ton of anxiety and just recently got diagnosed with body dysphoria. I was born as a baby girl and yet I can't identify with it. I recently got put on testosterone and hormone blockers to stop my body from producing estrogen.However it hasn't made any big changes which I understand. That stuff takes time. But until then I'm stuck looking like this lie that I tell everyone around me. To random people who pass me by, they see a girl. To my gay best friend, I'm a girl (I'm not mad that he doesn't like me...just wish my biology didn't work against me). To my grandfather who I live with (thanks to everyone in my family urging me not to tell him) I'm a girl. To my mother who still doesn't want to see her beautiful, thin, blond daughter who was everything she never was (her words, not mine) I'm still a girl. And I hate it. Typing this makes me feel sick to my stomach and angry.I...can't do this anymore. I look at myself and see a person who I can't continue to care about or identify with. I hate it more than I've hated anything else. I was always told that the worst thing I could do is lie. But living like this is just another lie that I can't wait to unbubble. I can't keep dealing with people seeing this false image of myself. Can't stand to see this image of myself. Can't stand to look myself in the eyes. I'm writing my goodbyes tonight. I just...I can't say goodbye in person.I've had a lot of time to think about this. I got sick with the flu this week and was bedridden and by myself a lot. I used to date someone who feels like my opposite. Back then, she was just coming to terms with being trans and I supported her. I'll admit it, I was jealous. I was jealous when I saw her smile when I did her makeup and hair. When she looked better in my clothes than I did I felt envy. That comfort she was able to see. She was able to see herself as a woman.I want that. Hard as I try to find anything that makes me look boyish, feminine attributes keep showing up. I can't hide my chest (even with binding) and my mother is utterly against me getting a haircut that is ""too short"". Why the hell can't I just do it regardless? I don't know why it's easier for me to come to terms with dying than getting her disapproval.Not to mention that in a couple of months I lose my medical plan so all of my meds are no longer going to be covered. There's no way I'll be able to afford everything. The antidepressants,  the anti anxiety meds, the asthma meds, and then the hormone stuff...especially with no job, I won't be able to afford it. And if I went on disability, I'd just disappoint my mother again. She's very vocal about how she wants me to get a steady job and go to post secondary. She's terrified I'll get disability. According to her, I'm not that bad off. The depression and anxiety isn't that bad. I should be able to keep a job...it shouldn't be an issue...Well at least this way, she can still have me buried with my legal female name. Might even be buried in a dress since I don't have a suit.

198,37840,"I have a friend in Japan who is depressed (long story shortened: multiple defeats in life including marriage, career, financial, academics, +family history of mental illness) and we feel a possible danger to himself.He is largely estranged from family, doesn't have close friends there--just a few former classmates. His close friends are here in the US. We have tried to help with his issues for over 10 years, but he has always been extremely resistant to self-help, seeking treatment, or outside advice. But we are not family, just friends, so don't have any legal standing to intervene.He has bounced back and forth between Japan and the USA and is currently in Japan alone and broke. We don't know exactly where he is living and he keeps in sporadic contact through Facebook and e-mail/text. His communications alternate between cryptic and alarming (exacerbated by the language issue).We've given him the Japan hotline numbers in the past and continue to do so.So do you have general advice of how to deal with depression and suicide risk in Japan, especially from afar? His friends in the US are at a bit at a loss about culturally/legally how to deal with this in Japan. Some friends are attempting to involve his family, but, again, they are estranged so I don't know how helpful that will be.Thanks for any advice you can provide. **Sorry in advance for impending wall of text...**I have a friend living in another country (he is in Japan, born and raised there) and I'm in the US. He is depressed, socially isolated, estranged from his family, his life has basically fallen apart over the past 15 years (failed academics, failed career, failed marriage). Burned lots of bridges over the years. He's working part time and just barely struggling to make it through each day financially, physically, emotionally. He's not receiving any mental health treatment/meds _PERSON_ have kept in regular e-mail contact with him, exchanging messages every several days. As per the talking tips from the sidebar, I've focused on trying to maintain rapport, empathizing, not judging. I thought this was going alright for a while, but he's reached the point where he literally sees no hope that things can improve, but he's not brave enough to end his life. I'm empathizing with that, not telling him ""it's not that bad"". Honestly, his life actually is pretty bad, at least measured by what he'd wanted for his life. I know that he can still find some happiness in his life (albeit with drastically lower expectations, but I don't say that, of course). My basic message is that even though things are really bad, if he can just survive each day, then he can give himself a chance for things to get better.For years, he's said he has no reason to go on living, but has never acted on it. But recently, he sounds like he is saying goodbye to me, thanking me for my friendship, that kind of thing. This has been going on for a few weeks now, but I still managed to keep him communicating. But his last messages have gone even more downhill, like he has to start looking for a painless way to go, wondering if he will have better luck in the ""next life"".Not sure what I should do at this point. I gave him the Tokyo suicide hotline numbers a long time ago (like 5 years ago) and I could give them to him again, but at this point, I don't think he would even use it. He's just given up.I wonder if I should advise he get professional help. I don't know if there is any way to compel treatment or even if that is possible in Japan without family involvement (as I mentioned, he's estranged from his family). We (other friends and I) have tried intervening in the past, but it just resulted in him getting angry/resentful and cutting off contact (the whole people not understanding him). So making that kind of direct appeal or action seems to go against the talking tips of empathizing and not judging.So, yeah, not sure if I should be writing something more direct, trying to take direct action, or even if those things are possible or advisable.Any insights/advice you can provide would be appreciated.**TL;DR--friend on another continent is suicidal and I am out of ideas/time/options**","Any advice on how to deal with overseas friend in Japan? trying to help a suicidal friend, but I fear it's hopeless",friend japan depressed long story shortened multiple defeats life including marriage career financial academics family history mental illness feel danger largely estranged family close friends classmates close friends issues years extremely resistant seeking treatment advice family friends legal standing intervene bounced back japan usa japan broke living sporadic contact facebook mail text communications alternate cryptic alarming exacerbated language issue ve japan hotline numbers past continue general advice deal depression suicide risk japan afar friends bit loss culturally legally deal japan friends attempting involve family estranged helpful advice provide advance impending wall text friend living country japan born raised depressed socially isolated estranged family life basically fallen past years failed academics failed career failed marriage burned lots bridges years working part time barely struggling make day financially physically emotionally receiving mental health treatment meds person regular mail contact exchanging messages days talking tips sidebar focused maintain rapport empathizing judging thought alright reached point literally sees hope things improve brave end life empathizing telling bad honestly life pretty bad measured wanted life find happiness life albeit drastically lower expectations basic message things bad survive day give chance things years reason living acted recently sounds goodbye thanking friendship kind thing weeks managed communicating messages downhill start painless wondering luck life point gave tokyo suicide hotline numbers long time ago years ago give point advise professional compel treatment japan family involvement mentioned estranged family friends intervening past resulted angry resentful cutting contact people understanding making kind direct appeal action talking tips empathizing judging yeah writing direct direct action things advisable insights advice provide appreciated tl dr friend continent suicidal ideas time options,advice deal overseas friend japan suicidal friend fear hopeless,11.0,363.0,0.1626324071746511,0.0,2.602689685444384,1.3988190440711956,2.0,268

201,38184,"I was always a hopeless person. Even as a child, before anything bad happened to me, I often felt a sick feeling of dread. It got worse when I was touched and injured by our old neighbor in elementary school. And even worse in middle school when my dad had a drug problem and our family fell apart. My mom and I always fought and things started getting really bad when I was about 15. That's when I made my first plan to kill myself but I chickened out. From ages 16 to 21, about 5 years, I dated the man I wanted to marry. He turned out to have schizophrenia. I spent years trying to help him get better but he left me. It's been 14 months since he left me but none of the pain has healed, I've only learned to bury it. He called me worthless and he was right, I am scum. I have no future, no goals, no hope of ever being loved. I will never be able to trust anyone. For a while I've been able to put off suicide by cutting, but I'm done with doing superficial damage, I want to destroy the entire body. I want it to be lights out for this pathetic, worthless, repulsive person that I can't believe is myself. I'm going to wait until I can see my parents and sisters one last time, so I can give them a happy last impression of me. In fact if I could find a way to make it look like an accident I would do so, because that's my only regret, that there's no way to do this that avoids hurting my family. But that's the way it has to be.Well, it's not my only regret. I guess I have a general sort of regret that I turned out to be a dud. The odds were so small that I was ever even born, it sucks that I failed to take advantage of what I had. At least it will be over soon and I can stop feeling guilty. Finally I will be out of people's hair. Finally I can stop working so hard just to keep living a life I hate. I'm glad I admitted this plan out loud, even if it was just to an Internet forum, it makes me feel calm to know the plan is in place and soon I won't be in pain anymore. Because when I'm sleeping, for a short time, it's like being dead- it's like I finally overcame my cowardice and pulled the trigger. like I finally accepted that since I'm not cut out for life, I should get the fuck out of here and give the space up to people that will make something of their lives.I fell asleep at 8 pm last night and even though it's 12:30 pm the next day, I still can't get out of bed. Sixteen hours of sleeping and wishing it was more permanent than that. I wish I was more impulsive (and less cowardly) so I could go ahead and swallow a shotgun and escape all this, rather than spend every day giving a sub-par performance at life and making those around me miserable too. What's the point of putting in the work to maintain my shitty version of life, when I hate it and spend every day wishing I was dead anyway? It's hard to do basic shit like going to work or taking a shower, when the whole time all I can think about is destroying myself. I only do it because I'm a coward and I'm not brave enough to pull the trigger.

My best friend doesn't give shit about me, I'm in fight with everyone I ever knew, I lost touch with my family (except my mom), girl I dated for 6 months probably forgot I even exist... Typical pathetic story, I know, but it's my story which I never shared with anyone. Ever. So I can be pathetic this one time, fuck it.My financial status ain't getting any better either. I work on a lousy job for a lousy pay with lousy people. I have nothing to expect from future, I have no talents to exploit nor particular interests to chase. I only work to provide money for my lousy studies and to bring food on my mothers table.

I'm not religious, I don't fantasize about any form of godly heaven, or anything like that. I just dream about the day I won't have to walk this planet anymore. It's such an attractive thought, sometimes even stronger than the fear of death itself. Hard to explain, but it is like that.To be honest, this is the first time I ever wrote or spoke to anyone in public about my suicide desire. I just googled suicide watch in google and came here since I spend so much time on reddit anyways.

204,38629,"One of my earliest memories was trying to drown. Supposedly carefree days of childhood were plagued with crushing depression that hasn't let up even into adulthood. I had thought about suicide so much that I feel desensitized to it.  I've tried OD'ing on sleeping pills, and hanging.  When I was in the ER after the sleeping pills, my parents told me that I should have shot myself like a man.I grew up without friends, barely have any now, feel terribly alone all the time even in crowded places. I regret my major choice and while I taught overseas, despite being good at it, I don't have any passion in teaching.  I've been back in the states for a few months trying to get better to no avail.  My savings from teaching are almost gone and I still have no idea what to do with my life.Transitioning to female and being published were two of my life goals, but I still feel miserable and like a failure. My fiance broke up with me the day after christmas.  Even those who said they'd stick by me always  can't deal with my depression.  I've tried therapists, medicine, group counseling, but still feel so hopeless and empty.  I feel as if I were broken.  Born too early, was going blind, mute, never smiling as a child and I moved around so much.  I remember sitting by myself during recess wondering why I couldn't be normal like the other kids.  Being transgender on top of that just made the bullying worse, was even tied up and locked in a closet by daycare staff when I was 6 for playing with dolls.Sometimes I feel like I'm a specter in others' lives, barely noticed and not making any difference in this world. There are times when I should be feeling happy, but I just feel like crying.  I feel terribly alone. My family still don't accept me.  I've lost interest in my passions or don't have access to them like having a pet or a piano to play.  Everything just feels so empty. I have lost appetite a year ago and even dropped from just being underweight to almost severe anorexia.  I've heard deep depression is when it lasts 2 years, but what about 31 years?So here I am posting to strangers for help, because I have no one in my life to turn to. After surviving attempts I have, I figured the bridge was the surefire way. Oddly enough, having it as an option has helped me in the past but the net project is moving forward so my time is short. In a way, it is as if someone was bricking up my fire exit and I can no longer take the heat of the fire. I've been hurting for so long...people say I'm strong, but I'm not I have been depressed and suicidal since as long as I can remember.  I first tried taking my life when I was seven.  I tried again and again, almost succeeding with a hanging.  My parents told me to kill myself when I was a kid... I don't have an accepting family.But these past few weeks have been horrible thing after horrible thing.  I had a recent breakup with the woman I love (I'm a girl by the way).  She thinks we need time apart.... a year of no talking if we will ever talk again.  I had to give away my dog, the closest thing to family that I have. My friend of ten years decided to no longer be my friend for a few months to teach me patience.  I lost my position at a suicide hotline due to being under stress despite being really good at it.  It was the one thing that gave me purpose in life.  Hearing others say I saved their life helped me to continue living despite dealing with chronic suicidality myself. So now I turn to strangers for help as everyone in my life has grown weary of hearing about my depression.  I lost so much in rapid succession.  I feel terribly isolated and alone.I have a plane ticket to jump off golden gate bridge tomorrow.  Part of me doesn't want to die... but this is all too much at once for one person to bear. I've tried therapy, antidepressents, I was even hospitalized.  Only thing that ever helped was my relationship as it was the first time I felt connected with anyone.",thinking of jumping from golden gate bridge Lost everything,earliest memories drown supposedly carefree days childhood plagued crushing depression adulthood thought suicide feel desensitized od ing sleeping pills hanging er sleeping pills parents told shot man grew friends barely feel terribly time crowded places regret major choice taught overseas good passion teaching back states months avail savings teaching idea life transitioning female published life goals feel miserable failure fiance broke day christmas stick deal depression therapists medicine group counseling feel hopeless empty feel broken born early blind mute smiling child moved remember sitting recess wondering normal kids transgender top made bullying worse tied locked closet daycare staff playing dolls feel specter lives barely noticed making difference world times feeling happy feel crying feel terribly family accept lost interest passions access pet piano play feels empty lost appetite year ago dropped underweight severe anorexia heard deep depression lasts years years posting strangers life turn surviving attempts figured bridge surefire oddly option helped past net project moving forward time short bricking fire exit longer heat fire hurting long people strong depressed suicidal long remember taking life succeeding hanging parents told kill kid accepting family past weeks horrible thing horrible thing recent breakup woman love girl thinks time year talking talk give dog closest thing family friend ten years decided longer friend months teach patience lost position suicide hotline due stress good thing gave purpose life hearing saved life helped continue living dealing chronic suicidality turn strangers life grown weary hearing depression lost rapid succession feel terribly isolated plane ticket jump golden gate bridge tomorrow part die person bear therapy antidepressents hospitalized thing helped relationship time felt connected,thinking jumping golden gate bridge lost,4.5,385.5,0.3674187846434871,1.0,3.068052935133617,1.3770733091465563,2.0,266

207,39703,"Hi,I'm hesitant to post this, as I have friends and family who know my username, but I have to get it out. Prior to about 2 weeks ago, I had never had a suicidal though. It came out of nowhere, and I can't figure out why it's happening. I'm 23Long story short, I graduated back in college with an engineering degree, and went straight into a corporate job. At first, I was really happy. College was very stressful for me, and corporate life is comparatively much easier. That said, my job isn't stimulating at all. A lot of times, I sit at my desk for 8 hours reading reddit and watching youtube. I can only work from home when I'm sick or can't otherwise make it to the office. I almost never have enough work to fill 40 hours a week. I look forward to leaving at the end of the day and coming home to my roommates. For my age group, I make excellent moneyHowever, the last two weeks or so, I haven't found any joy outside of work either. My routine is getting stale, and I'm not finding anything that can replace that routine, and I'm sorta stuck in a rut. I used to love video games. Now I don't, and I'm finding myself doing more or less nothing for hours after I come home. I might read for an hour, watch netflix for an hour, etc. Then I go to bed, wake up the next morning, and do it all over again. Then comes the weekend. Friday night/saturday morning are about the only time I'm reasonably happy. I might go out with a friend, see a movie, sleep in a bit. By about noon, I'm bored again, and the rest of the weekend is a slog.Now, part of it is that last summer I was rock climbing a ton, which I find very rewarding. Unfortunately, it hasn't been warm enough to climb recently. I'm seriously hoping I'm just going stir crazy. But then I start thinking about it, and I'm like ""I don't even feel like going right now"".So yeah, I'm starting to get the feeling that the things in my life that I used to find meaningful aren't meaningful anymore, and it scares the crap out of me. If I can't find meaning in my life, why live? At first, that thought was fleeting, but today while I was bored to death at work, that thought started to consume me. And it hasn't really left since. What the heck is the point of living if none of it is meaningful? If I'm just going to have 80 more years of nothing meaningful, then I have no desire to keep living. To put it succinctly, if every week is like the past couple weeks have been, I don't want to live. Objectively, the past two weeks haven't even been bad. And that scares the shit out of me.Please don't say ""wow must be nice to have your life"". I absolutely agree with you. I have a great family, relatively good job, a nice car, an apartment with roommates, and all I can think about is how bored I am all the time. And for whatever reason, my scumbag brain can't get rid of the idea that ""suicide will fix it!"". I'm just not finding joy in anything over the past few weeks. Not the gym, not rock climbing, not hockey, especially not work, not video games, you get the idea. Please help me. I don't want to end it all, but I'm feeling like that's the only way out.","I shouldn't be feeling this way, yet for whatever reason, I do",hesitant post friends family username prior weeks ago suicidal figure happening long story short graduated back college engineering degree straight corporate job happy college stressful corporate life comparatively easier job stimulating lot times sit desk hours reading reddit watching youtube work home sick make office work fill hours week forward leaving end day coming home roommates age group make excellent moneyhowever weeks found joy work routine stale finding replace routine sorta stuck rut love video games don finding hours home read hour watch netflix hour bed wake morning weekend friday night saturday morning time happy friend movie sleep bit noon bored rest weekend slog part summer rock climbing ton find rewarding warm climb recently hoping stir crazy start thinking feel yeah starting feeling things life find meaningful meaningful anymore scares crap find meaning life live thought fleeting today bored death work thought started consume left heck point living meaningful years meaningful desire living put succinctly week past couple weeks live objectively past weeks bad scares shit wow nice life absolutely agree great family good job nice car apartment roommates bored time reason scumbag brain rid idea suicide fix finding joy past weeks gym rock climbing hockey work video games idea end feeling,feeling reason,12.0,602.0,0.2031342987502479,0.0,2.4849066497880004,1.3202101449725838,1.0,202

213,40703,"I tried to kill myself a few months back, basically to avoid being a burden on society because I can't do anything right. I was in the psych ward for a week. I got out. I'm supposed to be better now, and for a while I was, with the exception of an apathetic outlook on life.A few weeks ago, our door got stuck shut when my cat was outside. I could have gone out through the garage to get him, but I was tired and not the most logical, so I opened the window that was next to the door and tried to lift the screen out. It wouldn't come out, so I forced it out and bent the frame in the process. Now it's unusable.My mom said she wasn't mad, but told me to be more conscientious next time. She was frustrated though, but seemed quick to forgive me for acting rashly.Today I told her about how our cat couldn't figure out which door to use when I called him in, even though he could see me, sort of as a humorous anecdote I guess because our cat is really dumb. But she started going on about how she was irritated that I was acting thoughtlessly and cost her a screen, and that she didn't know where to get one and how I never have to accept consequences for my actions because I'm not a responsible adult. I told her I was really tired and not thinking clearly. She told me, ""Sometimes you have to think clearly.""She asked me to load the dishwasher and went upstairs. Well of course during this time all I had to think about was what a fuck up I am, and kept imaging vivid images of my arms covered in cuts and bleeding profusely because that's just what I think about when I feel guilty. She came downstairs and asked me if I had any plans today, but I couldn't answer because I was trying not to cry. Then she figured that I was upset, and asked me why. After a long pause I told her that I didn't know she was still upset about the screen.Then she told me about how she had taken years to learn mindfulness, and it just drove her crazy that she had to see all these people go around and make stupid decisions without even thinking. After ranting for a bit, she said she was furious that I went back to my dad's, even after she'd given me this opportunity to have a better life. I couldn't tell if she meant the last time I lived with him or a few days ago when I didn't feel well and stayed with him because my appointment was near his house and I didn't feel like driving back (would have been an hour drive), but I didn't ask.Then she went on about how until I learned to do things for myself, I'd be a burden, either on her or society. She said it takes a lot of practice to be that mindful and to realize what the right choices are, but that every time I get close I just ""throw it all away"" because I want to be a victim or something. She again referred to me choosing to live with my dad (he's controlling and abusive). She mentioned how I can't stay in school and that I'll probably fail the next time I try because I haven't improved.I don't know if this is her odd way of motivating me. She said I should use these criticisms to realize what's going on and work hard to change. But I've been in therapy since getting out of the hospital to do just that. I thought I was working on changing.She said she was irritated about the window, but that it wasn't about the window. She asked if I could accept why she was upset. I didn't answer.The whole time it just made sense to me that I'm a fuck up and she thought of me as a burden. Everyone probably does. I tried to kill myself before because whenever I tried to change that, whether that be by holding down a job or going to school, I failed or was completely miserable. So I could be miserable not being a burden or make other people miserable by being a burden, which would also make me miserable, or I could just kill myself now and spare everyone and myself all the misery.I don't know why I'm writing this, other than to just get my thoughts out there. Or maybe there's another solution and I just haven't thought of it because I'm just a thoughtless zombie burden. I'm not sure.

Im a 17 year old male that has pretty much just lost the best friends he has ever had. All because he was unable to get over a girl. We tried to be friends, we managed to make it work for two months, but I never had time away from her after the break up due to our group of friends being very small and close knit. Im someone who puts others first so I couldnt ask my friends to leave her out. So I put up with the pain. We always get along extremely well and I love that, but at the same time it hurt. So now things have changed, I couldnt take the pain so I decided that I wasnt going to complicate her life (her lifes pretty messed atm aswell) after making her cry at a halloween party (Im a dick for it I know but I really didnt mean to) and now I have lost the best friends I could ever ask for due to not being able to ask them to just hang out with me.

I dont think Im mentally well but Im too afraid of what people (my mom especially) would think if I went to the doctors about it.Then this week starts, I find out my friends have been bitching about me behind my back since Halloween, and one (who I thought was my best friend) has only finally told me now, the rest are now ignoring me. So within a month or so, I have lost the people closest to me in my life and Im possibly stuck with some mental/emotional problem, Im only 17 with very little life experience and have extreme problems making close friends, they were the first true ones and this has happened...

The hobbies I once enjoyed no longer give me any pleasure. I have tried going to meetup groups and things to try and meet new people while doing the things I enjoy but these event always have cliques of people that already know each other and I can't seem to break into any of them - I just end up sitting there alone and miserable until I just leave. I can't even talk about my hobbies with regular people because I feel ashamed of them - they aren't ""normal"" things like watching sports and bullshit like that.I hate my job. The company I work for used to be small where everyone knew and talked to each other. Now we have gotten so big, I run into the clique problem at work too - I have no-one to talk to or have lunch with anymore because there is no-one at my work that shares my interests. I can't get in on any new projects at work because of changes in management - the new guy doesn't seem to like me and won't give me anything to do. All I do is fuck around on the internet all day and answer the odd question that people ask me. It's gotten so bad that I don't think I could actually do any real work now because I've been doing effectively nothing for years. It's a good thing I've been with the company for so long or I probably would have been fired long ago.Every time I see or hear other people together being happy I switch between either wanting to die because I know I will never have that, and wishing they were dead so I didn't have to see them and their happiness.Previously people on here have suggested stuff like adopting a kid or something. Yeah, great idea - I can't even take care of myself let alone another living creature.My parents try to be supportive. My dad is a completely different person to me (if you've seen Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, it's basically like Flint and his dad) and we don't really have anything in common. He doesn't know how to deal with any of this emotional stuff - he's an old-fashioned guy. My mum went through depression herself when I was younger (though she hid it well - I never even knew until she told me when I was diagnosed with it) and tries to offer support but it's like a broken record - the same unhelpful tips over and over again.The worst part is despite how bad I feel, I don't even want to change anymore. I think I am beyond help. I just want to be left alone. If I'm left alone I can scrape by being miserable, barely. But being surrounded by other people having a good time and having a great life makes me want to run away and hide. How can I get better if I don't even want to get better? Therapy has never helped because of this. I've been on meds but they always have bad side effects and are effectively a crutch - they mask the pain but don't fix anything.So, this is my wall of text. If you read it all, sorry for wasting your time.

I am EXTREMELY confused with my experiences in these 3 years. Every friend and family member I know have been in relationships for at at least 2+ years, so they have little input for current dating tips.I have met people on campus, through online dating sites, and even just chatting people up in the street.  I have done EXTENSIVE work to overcome my super shy nature for all of this.  I seem to be able to catch someone's attention to meet up once, and then I never seem to hear from them again after meeting up.  Several of these women have seemed very eager to meet back up, since at the end of the meet ups I got everything from hugs to kisses.  Yet every single time it usually ends up them just not responding to my texts a few days later.  I know that people can go through funks, but it seems that from the law of averages, I should have at least gotten a second date.  All of these experiences are starting to make me feel like I am doing something horribly wrong and offending people.  I am really starting to question my self worth and confidence levels in life, and I am just nervous that if this keeps up I am worried my self worth will eventually come to zero.I have to ask myself, ""Is the common denominator Me?

219,42934,"Hi. I'm a 19-year-old guy who immigrated to the US 10 months ago. I've been depressed for 3 years now, and suicidal for 2 years.Basically, as the title says, I don't have one single reason left to live on. There is no point. Let me tell you why.My parents are struggling financially. _PERSON_ is 60, and mom is 54 years old and they are both working at really tiring retail jobs. We barely make enough money for rent. We have to use the money we saved before immigration to pay for other expenses. Of course, that money won't last forever.It was my dream to come here, but nothing is going OK right now. I sometimes even think maybe this was a mistake.My parents came with us to help us financially so we could go to college. I have to work to pay for a community college. I don't even know how to pay for tuition when I transfer to a 4-year college. My parents surely can't do that for me.My twin brother abuses me physically, verbally and emotionally nearly every day and I can't live at somewhere else because I can't afford it.I have no friends so I can't talk to anyone when I'm alone or suicidal. Therapy is not working, I got used to my meds, and I don't have insurance so I can't go to the hospital if I become suicidal to get help.I am not that attractive, I am skinny fat and basically it fucks my confidence up. I have moobs and a beer belly (although I rarely drink) and am really hairy, so I am 100% sure no girl will ever like me. I've never had a girlfriend before and I'm a virgin. I know I will be alone forever and die a virgin.I also have hypospadias, a birth defect on my penis. I hate it. Girls will surely freak out if they ever see it. I also can't orgasm. So sex would be a nightmare for me AND my partner, if I ever had one of course.I see everyone around me having amazing cars and big ass houses and hot wives/husbands and doing everything that I want to but can't. Everyone is rich, everyone is hot, everyone has fancy clothes, everyone is in relationship (and probably getting laid), everyone is going out at night or doing other stuff and having fun. They are LIVING.I am not. I never will. My dreams won't work out. There is no hope. I've been trying for 3 years.

224,43739,"I'm in college right now, student-athlete, male, age 22. Lately, I've been having almost flashbacks of my school days where I was bullied. In my K-12 years, I was bullied constantly. I suffer from Aspergers syndrome and placed in RSP (program for students with disabilities). Other students knew this and gave me hell for it. I was called things like ""retard"", ""stupid"", ""special ed"", etc. I was physically assualted quite a bit during elementary school and middle school (I had my first suicidal thoughts at the age of 8). During high school it was more verbal, however I did have objects thrown at me. I was even called a retard by my 4th grade teacher for failing a drawing assignment. I was great at history but sucked at mathematics. I used to envy and loathe honor students. Many of the honor students also happened to be the popular kids as well. I was also told things like ""I would never pass middle school"". These events are over, however for some reason they have been tormenting me  recently. My self-worth is low and I'm viewing myself as a ""retard"" again like I did in my K-12 years. Secondly, for some reason I will have a crush on a girl. Then the crush turns into an obsession, then most of my time will be dedicated to thinking about her. These usually happen with girls that I know I can't have. And usually they have certain physical characteristics that I eventually obsess over as well. I usually find black and mixed race (black and something else) women the most attractive. Before that I used to be fixated on redheads, so on and so forth. Recently, I have been fixated on this mixed race girl that i have only met once 6 months ago. Don't even really know her. However, I have been thinking heavily about her recently. She goes to a christian college 400 miles away (I should probably note that I'm agnostic). We had a small talk and she gave me seemingly flirtatious smiles and giggles. Because of this I have been thinking about her heavily know, been totally fixated on her. I recently added her on facebook, but the friend request is still pending (it's been 3 days). Last time this happened it was with another mixed race girl and a black girl before that. It is driving me crazy, and ultimately extremely depressed. I also feel horrible that I'm fixating so much on a womens race, it feels so wrong, but for some reason I find black and mixed race girls extremely attractive. And I feel being fixated on specific girls and a specific race ruins opportunites with potentially awesome women. I feel lost. Lastly, I have been feeling isolated with almost everybody I know. I feel like I can't relate to anybody anymore. I feel like I can't express my feelings with people I know. I have been going to church to find a sense of community, but it's not really helping. I feel alone and isolated. I excersise a lot for my training for my sport. I spend about 2-5 hours each day working out. I lift 3 days a week and do cardio 5-6 days a week(I ran 5 miles yesterday). That provides me with temporary relief. But after that, I feel empty again. I get like this sometimes, but recently has been extremely bad. I don't know if I'm exactly suicidal, but I'm afraid of going down that road again. I feel out of whack Reddit, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Feeling extremely depressed lately.

225,43761,"It seems absolutely pointless to be alive considering my circumstances. I'm not good at anything, but don't have any desires. I feel dead already, why not have the physical match the mental? EDIT: (rant inbound)I do see a therapist and I don't know what to think of it. I haven't really done anything since high school, just a few jobs, last of which I was basically paid to be with a bunch of assholes, so I quit. Pissed off my sister. That was a month ago. Society wants me to go to college, find a girlfriend, get married, have kids and retire somewhere boring (like the town I went to high school in). I suck with women, I haven't been in that study mindset in years, no idea about the other stuff. I don't belong here, I don't know how to interact with people, I feel like an alien even taking the fucking subway. Lately I don't know if I even want to get out there and meet people. I've been isolating so long, but all these distractions (imageboards, videogames, movies, TV shows) just aren't as effective anymore. It sounds silly but you could say I was raised on the internet. My last and only girlfriend was two years ago, nothing since. No bar hookups, no one night stands, no FWB, zip, nada. I see a pretty girl and I long for a sniper on a roof to just take me out then and there. I don't know what I fucking want anymore. I really don't. So why can't I just die? I'm done with this life crap. There's nothing for me to offer here. I seriously dont care anymore. /r/redpill doesnt help. Low self esteem as a guy is torture. Im done with living with my parents and being the good kid. Im done with being told that im handsome (lie) and that girls will come eventually. Tired of feeling like shit all the time, but we all know im not going to do anything, so why waste the space? I had a decent run, its time to go.Im gonna miss ForeverAlone though... I suck with people, I get paranoid they're talking shit about me. I get angry, even when alone. I am easily demotivated and get frustrated easily. I cant talk to women without massively embarrassing myself and constantly compare myself to others. I cant make money to save my life, i must have ""invested"" thousands, money made online $2.07. I owe my bank $300 again and theres no way they wont kill my card. I still live with my parents at 23 and havent dated nor hooked up with anyone for two years. I want to move out but I have no credit, and I dont want my parents to be guarantors. My dad praises my little sister, meanwhile I am the black sheep of the family. Worst thing, I was going to buy cyanide but the site got taken down, and the replacement sites have no sellers for that. Would have cost $40... _URL_ my family asking me why I dont have a girlfriend. Lack of drive, I make a plan and never follow through. I know I posted here before, and I know I may annoy some of you, but no one else seems to understand. I cant fake anything, wear my heart on my sleeve. Family thinks Im just being moody. This is not moody, this has been consistent for a long time now. My therapist suggestedgroup therapy, but that doesnt give me much hope either. Last time I had group therapy, I still felt like freak, and when people tried to disproveone of my rants, I felt like I was being lied to. Sort of how my mother tells me Im handsome and that _PERSON_ find a girl. Its all bullshit, why waste air, why waste space? So you're telling me I either work for some asshole for the rest of my life, or I work for myself? Though anytime I try something it always fails. I feel like some people are just given life on easy mode and I'm just ""that guy"".I owe my sister $7000 and the bank another $500.Anything I try to make money on always fails for one reason or another. The last job I had made me want to jump out the window. Not the job, but the people I worked with. It felt like fucking high school all over again, except these are grown men in their 30s and 40s. Things never really change do they? I will always be that loser in high school who got made fun of by other guys and got disgusted looks by the girls. Fuck it. Even videogames, something some would say I wasted years on, I still suck at those. This is bullshit. I'm so fucking pissed that I can never do anything right. Ironically I'd statistically fail at killing myself as well at this rate. I don't care anymore. I want to die. I want this to stop. There's nothing for me here.I'm always angry and feel like a useless shit in everything. Nothing ever goes right for me, even stupid MoneyGram payments. Nevermind having no friends or acquaintances, nevermind not being able to talk to girls, even simple shit never works out. Apparently my bank declined the payment, which is funny because money is there. This isn't just one ""oh my payment failed, I suck"" thing, this happens all the time. Things that immediatly work for others, I always have to jump through 500 fucking hoops to get anywhere. As if I was flagged when I was born to always be a failure. Well joke's on you, fate.   I'm tired of feeling like shit all the time, I can't remember the last time I was happy. I'm just a waste of space, day by day it makes more and more sense. My dreams and hopes are bullshit, it's all pointless.EDIT: my captcha is BUYGON, that's interesting I seriously have no desire to do anything anymore. I'm unemployed and live with my parents. Some subreddits on here are depressing as fuck. /r/AskWomen, /r/theredpill, /r/seduction /r/rage /r/WTF friendzoning, marriages gone wrong, the 80/20 rule. The list goes on. It's hard to be positive when the negative has been your friend for so long. I guess I'm done. I have no value, and no drive to improve myself, so what's the point? Why am I even posting this? One of you once said you can't force me to improve myself if I don't want to. So why can't I just die?I usually get upset when I think of killing myself, but today is different. It almost seems *logical*... I have nothing, I'm a loser. I'm not rich, nor tall nor handsome. I don't have charisma, women are repelled by me. Frankly I don't care how family would react anymore. If that makes me selfish, or an asshole, or scum I dont know what to say. Actually thats been my reaction to everything lately. I don't want to die really, but I don't want to bother living either. I mean seriously what is the point? My grades suck, I can't make decent money, I'm a bitter social retard.  If by some miracle I did make friends and get a girlfriend, well that just brings even more problems. The only problem is I dont have a gun handy. Here I am, going back to the city. Going back to my mom, who will no doubt tell me I need to find a job and go to college. Who thinks that because I am suddenly on a campus or at a job, I will be happier. That girls will come with the job, that things will work out in five years. I cant wait around for five fucking years.The revelation was when I was at the bar the other day. Other people have no problem with social contact, making friends, chasing girls, dating, etc I just felt awkward and out of place. I dont have confidence, I dont have social proof. I was standing at the bar and two girls seemed to laugh at me.I dont know people, I dont have any skills except computers. I dont even have an interest in that field anymore. Frankly I get annoyed when family asks why Im so sad, they say things are wonderful. Things are not wonderful.Meanwhile I read stories ""Im dating her"", ""I almost got arrested there"" ""I went to Vegas with my friends"". Im having doubts SW. Doubts this will ever change. Ive always been shy, what chance in hell do I have of being the charismatic guy people love? Whatever motivation I have is quickly lost, so why waste anyones time and money?As an aside, this is somewhat ironic as about a year ago I was wishing to know what it felt like to be numb because I thought it was better than feeling like shit all the time. I guess now I know. I'm in my early 20s, I feel like my life is on autopilot. No wants, no desires, no motivation. There's a tiny part that wonders what if things were better, what if I could travel or make money or meet people or have a relationship with a nice girl?. What if I had social skills, so I wouldn't be a bumbling idiot around people; what if I didn't have severe social anxiety? Unfortunately the majority thinking is more along the lines of ""why bother, this will fail, you're an alien to the outside world"" among other things like ""you idiot, she'd never go out with you"".Most days lately have been:1.wake up2.watch _PERSON_ or go on reddit3.eat and shower4.see #25.eat again6.try to fall asleep6b.finally fall asleep at 3amLately though, it seems I just stopped caring about anything.","Why am I still here?

231,44776,"This may come off a little bit of a rant. Sorry.When I was around 8 years old, my parents got a divorce, my mother was a heavy drinker and was always pretty aggressive, she never hit me but she was just verbally abusive.From then on I dealt with her constant verbal abuse, while dad tried to win custody of me through court. Let me just say that dad is amazing, he gave up everything for me, and has always been a wonderful parent. Anyway, since all that happened, I've been really numb. It's hard for me to feel any happiness. Most of the time I hold resentment towards others, and I just have so much anger bottled up inside. I've always been able to function normally throughout the day, but I feel so numb. I'm not even sure of the last time I felt anything at all. So, today I've honestly considered just committing suicide.. I've actually thought about it seriously. I feel as though I *want* to end my life. I just can't think of a reason to live right now. All of my anger and unhappiness would just disappear.. I would feel even worse if I would try something and fail. Just another thing in my life that has gone wrong.I even feel pathetic for posting this, like I've failed somehow.. or I'm just posting so I can just get this off my chest.

233,45266,"edit: skip to the second to last paragraph, the one starting with the word ""first"" if you wish to help but don't want to read the rest of my rant.Just fucking failed my second calc exam, _PERSON_ every other class no problem, but this one is preventing me from doing anything. I may even have to drop to class to not destroy my GPA. My parents are going to freak out on me.But I have 2 exams and a lab report due tomorrow.The thing is that this only applies to the classes I'm taking now, the classes I took last semester were reading and writing intensive. I do poorly (by my own standards). I can't seem to focus to be able to read through an assignment, sometimes finding a video lecture helps, but that isn't always an option. Sometimes the material Is to in depth and specific for what I'm trying to get out of it (like trying to do Calc-based physics and only finding videos pertaining to algebraic physics) An internet Addiction doesn't help much either.I really want to be a doctor,  or PA at the least. Also considering engineering (but with calculus fucking me over, fat chance.) I don't have that great of grades due to a bad first semester. Right now I do some low level work in emergency medicine, working on becoming an EMT. I absolutely love volunteering for that stuff.My parents are some of the smartest idiots I know. I know they really care about me and want what is best for me, but sometimes what is best for me is just really fucked up. I can recall one time that (so my parents knew, but wasn't really the case) that I hadn't had a girlfriend in a while. My best friend at the time was dating this girl. She tried cheating on him with me, my parents found out and thought I should go for it, she even sent me nudes. Needless to say I didn't go for it, and I told him about it. Their advice has meant little to me ever since.I am lucky enough despite being 5'5"" and 250lbs (this one doesn't bother me that much) to find myself an attractive girlfriend. The only problem is that we are on such different intellectual levels. During our senior years of highschool I was 5 years ahead of her math wise. We have little common interest. The thing about this that pisses me off the most is that the crowd she hangs out with an I do. Sometimes I'll ask her to do something and she will flat out refuse. When her friends ask she goes for it and then invites me. Kind of pisses me off that they have more pull than me. She also kind of sort of cheated on me. My friends and I just finished the movie smiley, Which for some reason prompted her to get on omegle, she started talking to a guy on skype. She left herself logged in on my phone, he sent her a message. I went through the history and she referred to me ask her ex. This was on the 4th of July I found out, One year exactly since I met her and 2 days before out 1 year. (fortunatly or not, I couldn't get time off work from McDonalds Night shift so I told her I found out and left for my 10 hour shift.) My parents told me she didn't *really* cheat since it was just some random guy she met online and she didn't do anything physically, and said I should stay with her, well I did. I haven't cared about our relationship much since. I sometimes feel like the only thing driving our relationship is sex. We've been together for 1 year and 8 months.Now that I am in College, I have few friends, We rarely have time to see eachother (well I'm free, they're not) I went most of my first semester friendless, and now my friends just have no time for me. Being generally socially awkward doesn't help much either. I recently tried going to my schools anime club, just to find out I wasn't as into it as they are.This semester I have a room to myself, but last semester I had a roomate. Because I had no friends I knew no one was knocking for me. Nothing pissed me off more than when he wasn't in the room and someone knocked on the door. Every time I said he's not here without opening the door rage soured through me. I had little problem with the experience of having no friends, It was being reminded that hurt. It also doesn't help that I quit playing online video games with my friends because I was too much of a cheap bastard to bother buying a membership. When I got back to my room, I started doing some violent things to myself, I realize or at least hope I can cut my losses and make it through.I would like some help with resources and have various questions on the matter.First, I see that there are plenty of places to call, but I personally loathe phone calls. Is there anything text based resources wise. Some website I can go to, to get paired with a counciler?Second, I found my insurance card, I know my university accepts my insurance, my question is how can I make as little a paper trail to follow as possible, If my parents find out It will only make things worse. (someone once called the cops to do a wellness check on me when I was 13. The result of that was 6 trips to the psychologist and 4 trips to the psychiatrist. Psychologist and I got no where, for the psychiatrist my mother was always in the room and it felt as though he was just prescribing things at her will based on what she thought I had. Despite Good grades in high school one of the first things I got put on was ADHD medication. It only made me upset, my mother wanted me to stay on it because it was supposed to aid in weightloss. Then antidepressents, they made me lack the ability to feel any emotion, it was kind of nice looking back as I was more productive on them. Then the psychiatrist gave me a prescription that was $1000 a bottle, At this point my parents said he was a quack, and that was the end of getting psychological help.) I'm sorry for rambling. The resources are what I really want, the rest was just getting stuff off my chest. I don't want to use calling services. I have roomates.",Resources and moving forward.

235,45455,"This is a kinda long story. My fiance and I have been together since nov 2013, and wanted to wait a solid year before we moved in together. Our move in date was May 1st. I am disabled by my mental health (depression, agoraphobia, anxiety- about 10 pills to get through the day and get to sleep), I go to a support group and therapy weekly. When he, my fiance is around I feel safe and able to do more things. This was a big thing for me to look forward to, as a person who hadn't had much to look forwards to.Well he got into some trouble with someone he ought not have had anything to do with because of her age (that happened years before we met). He had been going to one pointless court date after another until the one last Thursday where he got a year probation. He's trying to get his probation transferred from there to here. So now we're fucked, had to let go of the apartment and everything associated.I know this wasn't done to intentionally hurt me. I feel broken. This seems to have pushed me over the edge. I feel like cutting almost all the time. I've even been thinking about taking specific pills in excess. I'm 33 and things haven't gotten better, the last few years they've been getting worse. The only thing that stops me is not knowing what will happen if I die. I've been waiting for things to get better for 30-some years and they just don't. I thought this was my chance at a normal life and at happiness. My kid would be better off with my family. My fiance would be better off with someone who lived near him and with a lot less mental health issues.  I can't do anything, shop, walk around the house without thinking about the fact that we should be picking those out, is he going to help me drive my son (they're close, considering we they only have every few months to see each other) to school. I cut twice. Since all methods of cutting have been removed I ordered a box cutter which has been sitting in the mailbox two days. I cry off and on most of the time.  I see my therapist today and that's great, but it's an hour then back to being alone.

I've come here to support you all, but by providing that support you guys are helping me deal with these emotions too.  It has been a really crazy and honestly a messed up year for me so far.  On February 19^rd one of my good friends decided to take his life.  This was exactly 6 days after he became an adult.  That's 6 days of living life as a supposed free man.  He had troubles with depression, honestly he was too smart for himself.  He knew what was going on internally and felt there was no escape.There was a way though.  He was very private about his emotions and condition.  I truly feel that if he was open to sharing these thoughts with others, the possibility to cure himself was there.  Everybody I know loved this kid, and we still do, but it hurts that he isn't here in physical form to show that love.Only two weeks later a teen I had little personal connection to committed suicide also.  I had texted him a few times, and he seemed like an extremely happy and wonderful guy.  Yet he hid his true emotions and feelings of despair.  I think about both of these guys almost every day, sometimes many times a day.So I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you feel like there is no way out, take a minute to find someone to talk to.  Don't be scared about how people will see these emotions.  I challenge each and everyone of you on this subreddit to tell one person how you feel about them or even what is on your mind.

For a while i would buy weed just so i could pretend i was friends with the dealer, i would then give it away to kids who smoked behind my highschool until they told me that i was creeping them out. I don't buy weed anymore. I'm completely pitiful. I have literally no accomplishments. I'm ugly, weak, skinny, and a 16 year old with a herniated disk, which takes working out out of the equation. I peed my bed last night for the first time in about a decade, cried, snotted and sweated until i couldn't tell what was wet from what. I've been to a mental hospital because i couldn't leave bed for 3 days. My parents ended up taking me out because the conditions there were disgusting. I look into my past and only see shame.My only sexual experience features me buying alchohol for a girl with a body count in the dozens. Getting a blowjob, and accidentally peeing in her mouth. The entire school district knows that, and that i have a small dick.I'll keep going but i'm on the edge. I've called the suicide hotline 3 nights in a row just to have someone pay attention to me.

I'm tired of feeling like I'm a burden on every one. Every one has to put up with me all the time. If I didn't exist then my parents wouldn't have to worry. They wouldn't have to deal with my stupidity and lack of ability to make good choices. They basically don't want me around to begin with. I needed a place to live and they wouldn't help me. I have 2 dogs that are like my kids so no one wants to put up with them there for they don't want to put up with me. They don't want to help me get through school. No one cares if I'm here or not. It's basically like I don't exist as is so why am I still here? My boyfriend wouldn't have to put up with my bad attitude and crankiness any more. He could be with some one that makes him happy but instead he's with me and I'm a constant anxiety full buzz kill. But I can't bring myself to leave him because I love him which is selfish of me to do. Another reason why I shouldn't exist. I've thought this since I was probably about 12 or 13. I was always a burden to my family because of my anxiety and lashing out periods. I never knew what it was at the time. I know now I have anxiety and I am constantly anxious about something and I know half the time it's something so little that I shouldn't even be worried about or that shouldn't cause me anxiety but it does. If I didn't exist I wouldn't have to worry about school or money or having a place to live any more.  I'm tired of constantly moving. I'm just tired in general. I posted an online add tonight to get rid of my dogs. I'm currently living at my boyfriends family home while he is finishing school and I finish my first year of my undergrad. School feels pretty much pointless right now since it takes all kinds of money and I'm probably going to come out of it with nothing anyways. So again, why do I need to exist? I don't do volunteer work, I don't donate to charity, I don't help people, I'm just a big weight, holding every one down from better things. My situations are so petty I feel bad for even posting on here. I'm sorry to any one who reads this.

I can text and email people, but I find it hard to really say what I'm feeling - I go off on tangents and then miss the point completely.I feel pathetic for feeling so down all the time. Even more so because it's about school and home when neither are that bad. Everyone else seems to be able to cope and I just feel like I'm faulty. I find myself crying if I can't do my work, then I make it worse by wanting to give up and not trying. When I get work back and I've not done well (which in my books is always) I feel even worse about myself.I self harm and recently it's not been enough - I keep thinking about how nice it'd be to not wake up. Or just to know that soon I wouldn't wake up. I don''t have the guts to kill myself, I could never be so selfish, but sometimes I just really wish I was dying. Cancer, or something. Anything. That probably sounds really heartless or mean, or something else it's not meant to :\ It's worse when another reason I feel shit is because I'm so utterly terrified of growing up - and there's only one way to stop that from happening... I just made a list of consequences of me dying, or well, not dying. The dying column had two. The not dying column had five. I'm in my penultimate year in school.

I come home, dump my stuff in my room and work for most of the evening, or I think about working, feel bad about not actually doing anything. I shower at half past nine and then am usually in bed at ten. I am a night person and I loathe getting up early (yes, 8 is early). I never feel like I've had enough sleep, never want to hang out with friends or do anything really. I never want to eat anything or drink anything. Most days I end up having a headache. I'm getting sick of the music I listen to and cannot find anything new.I'm just getting bored of it all. And I've been feeling like this for a few months now. I'm getting tired of everything. Of the work, of feeling tired all the time, of never wanting to do anything, never wanting to see anyone. Part of me hopes it's temporary, but I can't see anything changing. I need a break from life, it seems, but I won't get one for at least 5 months, but the thought of those five months is heart-breaking. I don't know if I can do it... don't know if I want to.

247,47707,"I am 23 years old. Just had an abortion. My best friend moved away and my other friends are too busy for me. I keep having fits of uncontrollable emotions I know are normal after an abortion, but I still feel alone and unsupported. I am unemployed. Got fired from my last two jobs for ridiculous reasons. Spent six years (still in progress) trying to get a degree I wish I had never started (music--what a waste), and now I can't go back because my financial aid didn't go through. I'm not sure I wanted to go back anyway. My boyfriend is trying to be supportive, but I know I'm pushing him past his limits. I'm destroying every relationship I have. I wish I knew how to fight this. For the most part, I'm being melodramatic. I posted here once before when I wasn't so much being melodramatic. Basically, I'm a fucking loser. I lost my last two jobs and now I can't get one to save my life. I had my hopes building all week when a recruiter finally gave me the time of day. He told me last week to call him this morning, so I woke up promptly at 8:00 and called his damn office only to be told the position was filled. Applying for jobs has been my full time job. If I don't get a job this month, I'll be evicted. I'm out of money. I'm out of second chances. So much for God giving a shit. I feel worthless.So yeah, probably not going to hang myself. Like I said, I'm just being a melodramatic fool, but I guess it doesn't fucking matter. I'm bipolar. Had a bit of a freak out tonight. I found out through a third-party than one of my roommates is planning on moving out in less than a month. I am so fucked for money right now it's not even funny. I've even had someone in r/loans lend me $70. It's still not enough. Not nearly enough. I know that finding out about sudden changes can set off an episode, but my stupid roommate hasn't even had the decency to tell this to me face to face. He's a goddamn coward. I got so angry I started yelling to no one really. Just saying, ""I knew he was a goddamn prick,"" and ""what a fucking asshole!"" At which point my boyfriend flew into a rage and started defending HIM. I got so angry at him I scratched him pretty bad. After I calmed down we ""talked through it,"" but talking through it with my boyfriend always means arguing until I get tired and then give up and start agreeing with him. And this is all after we had a long heart-to-heart over dinner last night over what we can do to improve our relationship. Things have been shaky here and there but otherwise strong. I know I'm totally boyfriend bashing now, but I'm still upset. GOD, even though I just want to go straight to the bathroom and down all the pills in there. I have plenty of muscle relaxants, anti-depressents, vicodin and generic shit in there to get the job done. I WANT SOMEONE TO JUST TAKE SOME PITY ON ME! Is that so wrong? Does that make me an attention-getting whore? Nobody's kind words will do anything at this point. Only money is going to help me get out of the mire that I'm in. I've been to the hospital THREE TIMES now within the course of one month!! ONE FUCKING MONTH. I barely make minimum wage as it is. And if anybody tells me to pursue government help I will fucking kill them. I have gone down every government avenue I can think of. Food stamps, charity care, health care, you NAME it, I've been trying to get the government to help me for over a year, but because I'm a student with financial aid, they can't really help me. AND MY FUCKING FINANCIAL AID DOESN'T EVEN COVER THE COST OF SCHOOL. Every term they tell me, ""well you still owe us XXX amount of money,"" and then I still have to buy books and supplies! All of this because I'm under 25 years old and my parents make a lot of money. Well it just LOOKS like my parents make a lot of money, my dad lost his job and they're strapped for cash now too! They can't afford to help me out or take a Parent Plus Loan. I'm so fucking tired of pursuing every single fucking avenue and being defeated in the end. Please. No one offer me money. I won't be able to pay it back.Nobody offer kind words, because I'm just going to fucking end it.Please, nobody tell me that 25 is too young to know my life is going to suck forever. That never helps. It just makes me feel like an idiot. GOODBYE. I'm tired of working 10 hour days and having nothing to show for it. My life is in the fucking crapper. People around me lie, cheat and steal and then they win the fucking lottery (like what just happened to my roommate, who is a poor excuse of a human being). THERE IS NOTHING TO LIFE EXCEPT BEING CRAPPED ON BY PEOPLE WHO ARE PIECES OF SHIT. I just can't do it anymore. Goodfuckingbye.","Just had an abortion--feel like shit.

251,48461,"I'd actually like to mention that I don't think I'll kill myself. I don't think I'll actually do it.But I need to tell someone about what's going on. If you're reading this, you're doing a very kind service to me. Thank you.I just... feel so alien here. Everywhere. I've been to so many places and I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't know if it's something wrong with me, but I feel this incessant hostility against my very own existence. I don't know where it's coming from, if it's an actual thing or a figment of my imagination. But dammit, I just feel like I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for all the suffering to be over. All the hurt.When's it going to end? When? There's been so much crying and wondering and philosophizing and meditating. There have been some ups, they've been lovely, but it's come to the point where I just don't feel like I can trust happiness.Like for example, if someone says they're happy, I don't believe them. I just assume that they haven't looked very deep into themselves. Their happiness is conditional, like I know that if I burned down their house, they wouldn't be happy anymore.I want peace.  I just want to be peaceful. I've seen some examples of peaceful people. I know it's possible, but I haven't figured it out. I keep thinking that if I can just penetrate deep enough, penetrate my psyche all the way through, if I can find the absolute rock-bottom of my existence, then I can live there and be well, finally be well.I feel like an old man, I can almost feel like I've done *this* over and over and over. I feel ancient. And I feel so tired. So tired!! I just want to rest, guys! There's this song that I heard almost ten years ago, called 'Solitaire-Unraveling' by _PERSON_ head, and is perhaps one of my favourite songs ever. One of the choruses goes:&gt;Time ticks away,&gt;These last few moments,&gt;Is there anything left unsaid?&gt;&gt;I'm on a quest for atonement,&gt;Got to find peace of mind&gt;and a place to rest.That's it!! That's exactly it! That's exactly my whole life! Atonement! Full circle. Finishing. Completing. Wrapping up. No more new karma, right, just saying everything that needs to be said, doing everything that needs to be done. Let me just say all my apologies for all the hurt I've caused in my various incarnations on this planet.I don't have a job, guys! I don't make any money. I just... whenever I think about getting a job, or work or something... it just feels so small, so *tedious*! My girl makes some money and she shares it with me. We're living in my parent's home and they share their food with us. It's not great. And my parents are like, well, how are you going to make money, son?I just wish, wish, wish, that someone would just give me some money. An apartment and some food, is all I need. Just some space from this pressure. Just a room where I can sit and no one's trying to tell me that time is running out, that I'm getting old, that I should be doing something else with my life.I'm just caught in this bind - things are not okay as they are, and no decent option is making itself apparent to me. So what to do? I feel like I'm being squeezed out existence? I feel rootless. I feel like a ghost. If it weren't for the people who I know, I'm not even sure how I could tell if I even exist!Perhaps the largest reason why I'm remaining alive is because of how much trouble it would be for everyone who loves me if I were to die. A couple of them might never recover. I realize that I don't owe my physical survival to anyone, but it still would be a touch impolite of me to off myself, I think.So I just wander, like a ghost. I walk around. I walk and walk and walk. What is there to do? I make some music. Drink some beer, sometimes. Meet up with friends sometimes. Meditate. Play music.Truth be told (and are you still reading? bless you. thank you. it really means the world to me). Truth be told, I don't care about my success on a financial, material level. Like I really truly don't. But I am tired of people looking at me like there's something wrong with me. Or looking at me like some discoloured solid that came out of their nose.I know they say 'who cares what other people think' and I *don't* care, but I do!Or maybe it's this, if I may bring up another thread of this monologue, I'm pretty sure what I feel is the collective suffering of humanity. I think I've tapped into it. Yes, this is what's happened. I feel it, guys, I feel *humanity's* collective suffering. And i chose to. I deliberately chose to feel it because I don't want to cut myself off of it. I want to heal it. I want to take great big chunks of it and heal it. I know I can, and I regularly do.But I don't make any shield of any kind. My heart is open. There's no armour. You can look right in. You can hurt me. I allow it. If you wish to hurt me, you can. Because I don't want to close myself off to you, I want to be open. I want to be open to all of it.My assumption about most of us who contemplate suicide is that when we do, it's because we simply can't imagine continuing to exist physically, it's just so painful.But what I would prefer to do is commit a *selective* suicide, whereby the part of me that HOUNDS me and judges me and worries and speaks like I'm not good enough could die. Not the whole thing, see? We're not throwing the baby out with the bathwater.I just want to... drop it ALL.I just want to really, truly, finally, once and for all, stop giving a flying fuck about anything.No more being productive, no more getting stuff done, no more flat abs, not even hope for a better future. Just peace. Finally, some peace and quiet.Yeah. Sign me up for that. Hello dear ones,Let my foremost message be to you that I love you with all of my heart. I love you.There isn't any need to upvote this. Any mods who are reading this, please go right ahead and remove this. I'm not close to suicide, but I'm of the suicidal *mood*. This might be familiar to you, who are reading this, the feeling of utter despair, utter pointlessness, utter helplessness. God! The helplessness. And not even the type of helplessness - such as cancer - that's obvious, and brings tax-breaks, and sympathy.I want to talk about money, here. I am perpetually with very little money, as are many, as are most. It's within my capabilities - with the application of a little elbow-grease - to drum up some money. Perhaps even a lot. Perhaps millions! I feel the raw resources are here for me if I but simply chose to accept and apply them.I don't feel as though anything is outside of my capability. Truly! I can sense my raw power, my connection to the Source of things, my infinite creativity. There is no door that's closed to me.Except this: How could it be fair if I get rich? The way money, economy, is set up, not everyone can be rich. In order for someone to be rich, another needs to be poor my comparison.It's certainly true that all of us can have an abundance of food and water and so forth, but not everyone can have as much money as the richest amongst us. Equal opportunity - absolutely - but only a few of us at a time can be rich.And having much, much money means that you don't have to work so hard because you can invest and reinvest. Money just makes money. And I could spend it on all of the most expensive things.But how could I? As a conscientious human being, how could I possibly spend, say, $200 at a restaurant, when that could be a month's rent for someone in Asia? How could I? How could I go skydiving, or own a second house, or own a private plane if that wealth could save lives and give _PERSON_ mean, yes, having money means that I can give it away.But I feel as though it's wrong to stockpile money. That's what I think I'm getting at. Because if you think about it, all of the resources that money could possibly buy are neatly spread out all over the world. But the money itself is so concentrated.And it continues to drift upward. Like gravity, you know? It just makes its way to the largest stockpile in the same way that all rivers eventually lead to the ocean.And even if I were inclined to position myself near the center of such wealth stockpiles, I would necessarily need to be competitive, in order to do so. I would need to stand against one of my very own brothers, all descendants of _PERSON_ (metaphorically, of course) and convince myself that I'm more deserving than he is.How could I compete for money? How could I allow myself to be in possession of large money stockpiles? Especially when I myself need so very little? And it's true: I need very little. It might be said that I need more money than I have, but not that much more.Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I don't really want to stockpile it at all, but instead just participate in its *flow*. Open up a stream of it to come in, only to let it back out again. Like an ever-fresh stream. Yes.The other matter is this: expectations.I don't know from where they originate, but I can't seem to shake this feeling that something is being expected of me, and I don't know how to meet those expectations. I often dream of being able to exist in such a situation that I am left entirely alone, with nothing being asked of me, nobody is waiting for me impatiently.But I think I have high expectations of myself that I'm projecting on everyone in my life. I feel like I need to do something, but I don't know what. I just feel... pressure. Pressure. Pressure to do something. To do what? I don't know. But it's like I'm locked in this constant state of disappointing some nameless entity that resides within me.Disappointment. There's so much. Disappointment.  And in all of its phases, like impending disappointment, current disappointment, past disappointments. Helplessness, hopelessness. As a young boy there was so much promise about me, and now... none.How nice it would be to be already, say, 88 years old. And no one is expecting anything from this crotchety old many anymore. He's free to just read books and admire the sunrise.There's this voice in my head, not a voice, but a series of unarticulated thoughts that, when articulated, say:""I hate you, Brent. You're wasting your life. You should be working. You should be doing something. You don't deserve anything. Everyone hates you. You've made too many mistakes. You've wasted too much time. I am causing too much trouble to my parents. In this moment I am wrong, and am wasting time. You can't show your face anywhere, you do not want to be recognized for fear of embarrassment. You are embarrassing. Get to work. Follow some procedure. Stop delaying."" ""Waste."" ""Disappointment."" ""Leech."" ""Failure."" ""Pity."" When the words fade away, I'm left with these reddish feelings. A burning... sort of core? like an ember. A dense core of tension. Tight vibrations. It seems to shrink away and put up a shield when I inquire into it.Dark, muddy greens. Dark crimsons. Tightness in my chest, head, shoulders. Fear. Anxiousness. ""No!!"" ""Don't look at me, do your work first."" It says. And yet I can't seem to do anything else. This seems to be as far as I'm able to go. If you've read this, I really appreciate it.

He was away over the weekend with his parents and when he came back he said he and his mom had gotten into a fight which I don't believe is normal for them. When I got home from work today, I didn't see him, so I got changed and knocked on his door to see if he was home. I didn't hear a response, but I knew he was home for some reason. I opened his door and saw him sleeping in his bed. No big deal, I thought, even though it was almost 7pm. He keeps a strange schedule sometimes, so it wasn't totally out of the ordinary. I let him sleep.About an hour later, he comes out very groggy, goes to the bathroom, and heads out to get cigarettes and beer. He goes into our back room to smoke, and I follow trying to get a feel on what's going on with him. He then tells me that he took sleeping pills and alcohol that afternoon to try to kill himself. Obviously I was and am in shock and didn't really know how to react. I asked questions about why and for how long he'd felt like this. We hugged it out at the end of the night and I told him I was there for him.

259,49639,"During a depressed period during my high school years I contemplated suicide. Fortunately I sought help from professionals before doing anything and came out much better for it. Yet what one person whom I went to school with said when they found out I was suicidal has stuck with me forever and I will always owe that person a debt.I was selfish at the time, thought only of myself as teenagers often do. I figured it was my life, I could do what I wanted with it.That girl told me a simple line I wish the world could know.Your life is not entirely your own.You are your parents child, your grandparents grandchild, your friend's friend. You are your siblings sibling, your love's love and above all you are a part of the lives of everyone around you. Your leaving doesn't effect just you, it effects everyone you've ever known who learns of your passing. Your leaving causes pain, hurt, loss. Your life is not entirely your own.From this I have tried to live the best life I can while we can because my life means more than just my existence.This does not mean you shouldn't kill yourself out of guilt to what pain you will cause when you leave. It means you should find reasons to live and be great. Life is great when you remember to enjoy the simple things. Take a shower and *feel* the water. Sit down in the shower, it's wonderful and worth living for. Use cold water to remind you how nice hot water is. Use hot water to remind you how good cold water is. Walk outside and *breath* the air. *See* the sky, the ground and the leaves. *Taste* food, *smell* everything, *feel* something soft. We take for granted every day the best things in life. Smile at someone just because you can. It's amazing how many smiles you get back that just make your day. Depression surely sucks. It makes everything bland and sad. That doesn't mean it has to define you. Some of the greatest people who ever lived suffered from depression every day. My greatest hero, _PERSON_, suffered from depression and he changed the world and stopped the suffering of potentially billions of people. Lincoln was sure he wasn't cut out for politics or the presidents office. He was full of self doubt and worry. He thought he would ruin America. Instead he became arguably the greatest president to ever live because he didn't let depression or suicidal thoughts win. He fought every day to make things better. [The list of how many people live and lived with major depression disorder will shock you.](_URL_ suicidal means you think things can only get worse or never get better. You probably think you're worthless. I'm going to tell you this isn't true. Your life is worth *everything*. To me, to your loved ones, to anyone who has known you. You have value. You have meaning. All you have to do is believe it. Come back to the world. It is a wonderful place because we can feel pain. Because we suffer we know what is good. Because we have pain we know pleasure.

275,51455,"I was the first person in my family to ever graduate from high school. Neither of my parents ever received an education, because they grew up as poor farming peasants in Mexico. They raised me, but I was never given any instruments to play, nor was I ever placed in any sports, or any drama classes or self-defense classes or classes that bred hobbies or taught any skills that would have made me even somewhat of an interesting person. I don't come from money or a background that values education or ambition. I realized, way too late into my life, that I missed out on a proper childhood. I spent my summers and free time at home watching TV and playing video games rather than going to camps or discovering an intellectual interest or participating in sports programs or engaging in any social activity. I've been diagnosed with a mild form of autism, and have also been diagnosed with intense general anxiety. Even if I try to connect with others, I can't. I'm just too different. Not even with my family do I feel a close attachment.Somehow, I excelled in school and through divine intervention I attended a top private liberal arts college. I thought the world would be my oyster, but I'm not cut out for the world. I offer nothing and don't have the social skillset or any of the artistic or academic talents to mesh with any of the school clubs or its members. I was ill suited for higher society, but now I'm too educated and too ambitious to go back from where I came from.Everyone around me is being elected to leadership positions and attending conferences and earning internships to elite corporations and organizations, and I struggle just to keep up academically.I used to try so hard to fight. I saw myself as an isolated fighter who had to navigate the cruel, difficult world on my own. I sacrificed my health to push myself, give it all I had. But even when I put twice the effort as everyone else, I still finish behind everyone. I kept trying and fighting. I refused to go down. I needed to believe that I was worth something and needed to prove to myself that I was capable of doing something worthwhile. For everytime I faltered, I pushed and fought harder, but I still failed.Now I've reached my limit. I'm not meant for this world. I had nothing and I still have nothing. I'm just a freak to everyone. I tried, and I gave everything to my cause, but it was all in vain. I guess I'm just some nervous, autistic low life who can barely do anything right. I'm tired of fighting by myself. I'm tired. I hate myself, and I hate my thoughts. I can't do it anymore. I just want to rest forever. I wish there was a heaven, because I don't want to be here anymore. 20 years, and nothing to my name.

276,51526,"I posted here a while back when I needed to find myself again.I did indeed get better for a little while, while I was at university for my first semester.Since possibly about early december, I have increasing sadness in my life again. I do not know what I can do about this. My parents are leaving me with the house while they go on holiday for 2 weeks tomorrow.I fear I may not be able to hold it back facing 2 weeks of near absolute loneliness with me just doing revision and coursework. A bonus is that a friend is visiting me for new years eve, to have a drink etc.Should at least make things bearable for those days he is here.I just need someone to help me. My friends have, to an extent, told me to not talk about it with them. As I don't take their advice so they have given up in trying to help me out with it.To me, I seem like I'm attention seeking for this, but I need help. And right now, Reddit is all I have.Without this site, I wouldn't be here to this day. I don't know where to start, with this.I guess I'll explain a little about myself. Even revealing my name so that people can at least see me as a person rather than just an account on reddit.My name is _PERSON_, I'm 20 and from the UK, currently in my second year of a UK top 20 University. I also study distance learning at the Open University at the same time to further my skills in something I feel was lacking.I'm very selfless. I will give my lunch to you even if I haven't eaten in days. I live for others to be happy and screw myself over if it makes someone else happy as a result.My closest friend who was an American national, studying abroad, introduced me to a girl way back in January of 2010.  We got talking and we eventually got together sometime in the February. We had a really good relationship together, she was rather sensible and had a good cheery personality, albeit bipolar from time to time.Then in mid december, the final week of my semester, I have two assignments to be completed and a test by the end of the week. I was consistently pulling all-nighters to get the work in on time due to unfair deadlines for submissions. Then she says that she doesn't deserve me because of how well I treat her, and she feels as though she upsets me all the time.Now I have had depression since 2007 so it was commonplace for me to feel upset a bunch of the time.We manage to ride that little storm, and on new year's eve, she commented on a status I had put for new years, replying to my american friend who also commented on it. It simply said ""I'm going to win that bet!""So, me being a little curious, I ask her what the bet was.She was honest and said that she and my best friend had a bet on our relationship. He, betting against us, and she betting for us.I got angry because of this. Because 1, she never was very open about it, and had no intention of telling me unless I had asked, considering that bet had been made a week prior, and 2, betting on a relationship lasting or failing is just plain wrong.The next day, after new year's has been celebrated and what not. I speak to her to figure out what the hell went on. She mentions that we can't be together anymore. I cry and get upset at this because she said she just doesn't love me anymore, even though I had given her everything I possibly could. I tell her not to talk to me until she has a good reason to.A week later. She begins to talk to me, checking up on me because of some worrying behaviour she had caught from me being around online.I ask her again why she just stopped loving me. She said, as bluntly as she had ever been with me, it was because she had never loved me, she tried to force herself to love me but couldn't because she loved my best friend and was trying to go for him.I felt crushed, defeated, horrified, and just the worst I had felt in a very long time. The fact she then said I should just ""deal with it"" upset me further.I'm a person with a declining social life, and having this happen to me is making things 100 times worse. I just feel so horrible still to this day. It's been nearly a week now since it happened. I can't sleep properly. I'm eating at most, 1 meal a day, and just drinking constant energy drinks. I have exams currently so focusing on them is very difficult. I just have feelings of just giving up.I have had a dwindling social life for a while. I could effectively get rid of my phone and no one would know. No one speaks to me on it.I just feel so horrible about it all. I feel ashamed, angry, deeply upset and just so alone.I've just had no determination or drive to do anything of recent. Some of the day's I haven't even left my bed. Starting to get those horrible feelings of suicide and self harm back in my head after not being there for a considerable amount of time. I'm trying to get better, and get out of depression but it is just getting worse and worse. I feel awful right now.Sure, you might say I'm doing well for myself, because I'm at a good university. I don't feel that pride, and I've never been able to. My parents simply did not approve of me going to university, with their old fashioned ""must get a job at 16"" ideology. I'm constantly reminded of it.I honestly feel like I don't deserve where I am. I have nothing to offer what millions of others haven't got. Apart for the fact I have never had a paid job in my life, because I took studies very seriously and didn't want a job to ultimately cause me to drop a grade or two.This probably makes no sense whatsoever, but I'm going to post anyway.I have an exam at 2pm today, it's currently 3am and I just have no intention of sleeping. I've been living off extreme lack of sleep in the past few days yet I'm not tired at all. I'm just giving up on the studies I used to find incredibly fascinating and enjoying, due to all of this. I just don't have any drive to succeed in life anymore.I'm being pushed to the edge by everything going on in my life right now, being tested from all fronts, and I just don't know if I can hold on through it. Hi all. My name is _PERSON_, and I have posted here before.On my way home today I thought it may be a good idea to help others and explain my story.I had posted here around 9 months ago, with the following post:_URL_ felt really awful about things going on in my life, and didn't really feel like doing much about it. I just felt like I was going nowhere and I behaved as such. Isolating myself from everyone, not talking to people, acting mopey etc.After some talking with someone from SW and others. I had then taken the step to visit a councillor and try to see if it would help with my problems. Also around this time, I took up doing my favourite sports again (something I had stopped a long time ago) and began talking to a friend of a friend.As time went on, that friend become an important part in helping me feel better and be able to put that smile back on my face.On reflection on things. They have gotten significantly better in the time since I had spoken to the councillor and taken the steps to improve myself, even if before that, I felt like it was going to be a useless waste of time and that I couldn't pull myself from it.Next time you think that things can't get better for you, they really can, and your life can be significantly better for you if you take the time and the steps to help yourself! I cannot stress this enough. It was hard enough for me to just ""take a night off"" from work, as I was just using it as a shield for my own unhappiness even though it was killing me to keep working.Since all of those events had occurred, things have picked up so much. From talking to that friend, things between us have sprouted, and now we're currently in a rather happy [relationship ](_URL_ wants to be a councillor when she graduates so I had the suggestion to her to help out the people in this and the /r/depression subreddit so that she can help people. She frequently checks this and the /r/ depression subreddit. [Username](_URL_ thank her, and everyone here, for all the great and amazing work you all do.
